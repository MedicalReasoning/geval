A chest X-ray and skin test are typically used to diagnose TB.\n\n### Management:\n\nTreatment for TB usually involves taking multiple antibiotics for several months. The specific antibiotics and duration of treatment will depend on the location and severity of the infection. It's important to complete the full course of treatment to ensure that the infection is completely eradicated and to prevent the development of drug-resistant strains of TB.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWhile other conditions like bronchitis, pneumonia, and pulmonary neoplasms can present with similar symptoms, the patient's history of recent travel to a TB-endemic area, chest pain, night sweats, and rash, along with the results of the chest X-ray, support the diagnosis of Tuberculosis.",
