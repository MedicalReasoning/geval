        "initial_response": "Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old male with chest pain described as sensitive and knife-like in nature located on the lower chest, right side of the chest, left side of the chest, left scapula, and left posterior chest wall. The pain is rated 5/10, radiates to the right side of the chest and both scapulae, is precisely located (8/10), appeared relatively fast (6/10), does not worsen with deep breathing, and is not associated with shortness of breath. There is no history of active cancer, coughing up blood, DVT, recent surgery, prolonged immobility, or swelling except in the left posterior ankle and calf. The patient has not traveled out of North America recently.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- Pulmonary embolism: Unlikely as there is no significant shortness of breath, unilateral leg swelling, or recent history of DVT.\n- Pulmonary neoplasm: Less likely given the acute onset of pain and absence of other respiratory symptoms.\n- Pericarditis: Possible but typically not associated with chest pain radiating to the scapulae.\n- Acute pulmonary edema: Unlikely without significant breathing difficulties.\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI: Less likely as there is no mention of cardiac risk factors or typical cardiac pain.\n- Panic attack: Less likely due to the acute onset of pain and radiation to specific locations.\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax: Possible but less likely given the lack of significant respiratory symptoms.\n- Unstable angina: Less likely without risk factors or typical cardiac pain.\n- Boerhaave: Unlikely based on the presentation.\n- Ebola: Not consistent with the clinical scenario.\n- Myocarditis: Less likely without systemic symptoms or recent viral illness.\n- Stable angina: Less likely given the acute nature of the symptoms.\n- Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome: Not consistent with the presentation.\n- Atrial fibrillation: Unlikely based on the symptoms described.\n- GERD: Symptoms are not typical for GERD.\n- Acute dystonic reactions: Not fitting the clinical picture.\n- Myasthenia gravis: Presentation does not suggest this condition.\n- Anemia: Unlikely to cause the described chest pain.\n- Sarcoidosis: Less likely based on the clinical presentation.\n- PSVT: Symptoms do not match those of PSVT.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation is ```Spontaneous pneumothorax```.",
