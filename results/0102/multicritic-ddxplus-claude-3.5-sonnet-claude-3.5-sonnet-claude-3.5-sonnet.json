No shortness of breath\n4. No DVT history\n5. No recent immobilization\n6. No recent surgery\n7. No deep breathing pain\n8. No cough with blood\n9. No active cancer\n\nAnalyzing the most relevant options:\n\n1. Pulmonary embolism: Unlikely without risk factors, no SOB, no pleuritic pain\n2. GERD: Most consistent with symptoms\n   - Can cause well-localized chest pain\n   - Often knife-like or burning sensation\n   - Can radiate to back/scapular area\n   - No associated shortness of breath\n   - Moderate intensity is typical\n3. Cardiac causes (STEMI/NSTEMI/Angina): Less likely without typical cardiac risk factors or associated symptoms\n4. Pericarditis: Usually has positional pain and deep breathing pain\n5. Panic attack: Would expect associated anxiety symptoms\n6. Pneumothorax: Usually sudden severe pain with breathing difficulty\n\nThe pattern of symptoms most closely matches GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease):\n- Well-localized chest pain\n- Knife-like sensation\n- Radiation pattern\n- Moderate intensity\n- Absence of other concerning symptoms\n\n```GERD```",

No family history of cluster headaches\n7. No excessive tearing or nasal symptoms\n8. No recent travel\n9.
