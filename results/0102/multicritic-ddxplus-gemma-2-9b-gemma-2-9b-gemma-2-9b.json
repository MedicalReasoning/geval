The patient's pain is constant, not exertion-related.\n\n* **Pericarditis:**  Sharp, stabbing chest pain that worsens with breathing or lying down. The patient's pain is described differently and isn't worsened by these positions.\n\n* **Anemia:**  Usually doesn't cause chest pain.\n\n* **Stable angina:**  Predictable chest pain triggered by exertion, relieved by rest. The patient's pain is constant.\n\n* **Boerhaave:**  A rare and life-threatening condition with sudden, severe chest pain, often after vomiting. The patient doesn't have this history or the intensity of pain described.\n\n\nGiven the description, the most likely diagnosis is **Unstable angina**.

This rapid onset and severity point away from stable angina, which usually develops gradually. \n* **Location:**  Pain in the lower chest, side of the chest (right), and upper chest is consistent with pericarditis, which involves inflammation of the pericardium (membrane surrounding the heart).\n* **No radiation:** Pain not radiating to the left arm or jaw is less typical of an acute coronary syndrome (like NSTEMI/STEMI). \n* **No chest pain at rest:**  This rules out unstable angina.\n* **No history of pneumothorax:**  Rules out this possibility.\n\n**Other Options:**\n\n* **Unstable angina:**  Would likely involve chest pain at rest and possible radiation to the arm or jaw.\n* **Stable angina:**  Would be triggered by exertion and relieved by rest, not instant and severe.\n* **Possible NSTEMI / STEMI:**  While the pain is intense, the lack of radiation and other typical symptoms makes it less likely. \n* **GERD:**  Usually burning sensation, not this type of sharp, sudden pain.\n* **Atrial fibrillation:**  May cause chest discomfort but usually not this severe or localized.\n\n**It's important to note:** This is a clinical scenario, and a definitive diagnosis requires a physical exam, ECG, and potentially further investigations.\n\n\n\n```Pericarditis```",
