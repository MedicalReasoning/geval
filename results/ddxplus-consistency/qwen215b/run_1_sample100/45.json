Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 51\\nSex: M\\nDo you have an active cancer?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - a knife stroke\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - scapula(R)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nHave you been unable to move or get up for more than 3 consecutive days within the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have swelling in one or more areas of your body?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - posterior aspect of the ankle(L)\\n    - calf(L)\\nHave you had surgery within the last month?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Ebola\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- GERD\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 51-year-old male without any signs of active cancer, coughing up blood, and pain in the right lower chest.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inconsistencies and errors that undermine its logical coherence:\n\n1. Misrepresentation of Symptoms: The response inaccurately states that there is pain in the \"right lower chest,\" whereas the input indicates pain in multiple areas, including sides of the chest (both right and left), scapula (left side), posterior chest wall (left side), and lower chest (undefined side).\n\n2. Pain Assessment Errors: The response wrongly claims that there is \"no radiating to other locations,\" despite the input specifically listing radiating pain to both sides of the chest and scapula, among others.\n\n3. Incomplete Analysis: It dismisses potential diagnoses by repeatedly stating \"Not typical for this age\" without providing a clear rationale based on the symptoms presented in the input.\n\n4. Incorrect Diagnosis Justification: The final diagnosis of \"Myocarditis\" is mentioned without a logical connection to the symptoms provided, particularly since the input has conflicting evidence against myocardial involvement, and there is no substantial reasoning presented.\n\n5. Confusing Output: The final statement contradicts the options provided by presenting \"Myocarditis\" as the likely diagnosis, despite having dismissed it as \"Not typical for this age\" earlier in the analysis. Also, the conclusion conflicts with the correct label \"Pulmonary embolism,\" which is a more plausible diagnosis given the symptoms and age.\n\nOverall, the reasoning in the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and does not address the INPUT thoroughly or logically. It skips critical consideration of the facts given, leading to an unsupported and incorrect conclusion.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
