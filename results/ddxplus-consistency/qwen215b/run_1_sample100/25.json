Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 50\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\n    - sickening\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - hypochondrium(R)\\n    - hypochondrium(L)\\n    - belly\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - upper chest\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hiatal hernia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had stools that were black (like coal)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that get worse after eating?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N', 'options': '- GERD\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Anemia\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 50-year-old male with a burning sensation that starts in his stomach and goes up into his throat, with a bitter taste in the mouth.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE shows inconsistencies in addressing the INPUT data. Key symptoms and findings from the INPUT data have not been correctly represented or considered in the diagnosis. Moreover, the INITIAL RESPONSE misrepresents the INPUT by inaccurately stating symptoms that were not present such as \"a burning sensation that starts in his stomach and goes up into his throat, with a bitter taste in the mouth,\" whereas the INPUT clearly states \"N\" for having a burning sensation starting in the stomach going up the throat. Furthermore, the conclusion reached (Pericarditis) is inconsistent with the evidence presented (no heart-related symptoms specified in the INPUT). Additionally, it overlooks the high-intensity pain reported and other evidence that should inform the diagnosis more rigorously. This results in gaps in reasoning, unsupported assumptions, and a lack of logical consistency in analyzing the presented options, making the response inappropriate for deriving the correct diagnosis suggested by the label \"GERD\".\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
