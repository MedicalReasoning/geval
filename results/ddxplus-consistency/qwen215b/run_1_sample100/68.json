Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 64\\nSex: F\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nHave you had one or several flare ups of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the past year?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux?\\n    - N\\nDo you work in agriculture?\\n    - N\\nDo you work in the mining sector?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- PSVT\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 64-year-old female with shortness of breath, chronic cough, no color or增多的脓痰，未诊断过GERD，未从事过农业或矿业工作，最近没有出过境，没有出现喘鸣声。她的症状与急性COPD（慢性阻塞性肺病）有关。\n\n```Acute COPD exacerbation / infection```\n\nLABEL:\nAcute COPD exacerbation / infection\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE inaccurately summarizes the INPUT and jumps to a conclusion without following a logical reasoning process.\n\nFirstly, the INITIAL RESPONSE mentions \"a 64-year-old female with shortness of breath, chronic cough...\" which is not consistent with the INPUT. The INPUT clearly states that there isn't a significant experience of shortness of breath, no chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and no cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual. Therefore, the initial response misrepresents the given evidence by suggesting symptoms that are not indicated in the INPUT.\n\nMoreover, it concludes with \"她的症状与急性COPD（慢性阻塞性肺病）有关。\" (Her symptoms are related to acute COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)) which conflicts with the provided answers indicating no COPD and no related symptoms. There is a clear logical inconsistency in confirming symptoms or conditions that have been explicitly negated.\n\nThe selection of \"Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\" as the final option is inconsistent, given that the evidence heavily opposes it. Such a conclusion does not follow a coherent and logical progression of thought, indicative of significant gaps in logic and unsupported assumptions.\n\nPREDICTION: ```PREDICTION```No```"
