Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 87\\nSex: M\\nAre you currently taking or have you recently taken anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - heavy\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - ankle(L)\\n    - thigh(L)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(R)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(L)\\n    - sole(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have heart failure?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have liver cirrhosis?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had surgery to remove lymph nodes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have swelling in one or more areas of your body?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - ankle(R)\\n    - thigh(L)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(R)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(L)\\n    - sole(R)\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Localized edema\\n- Chagas\\n- Anaphylaxis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nAn 87-year-old male presenting with knee and thigh pain, which \"seems to come on suddenly.\" Pain is described as heavy, tedious, and sharp.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE lacks consistency for the following reasons:\n1. The response includes an inaccurate interpretation of the INPUT data. The pain locations mentioned in the INPUT are the ankle (L), thigh (L), dorsal aspect of the foot (R and L), and sole (R), while the INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly mentions \"knee\" and \"thigh\" pain, skipping other specified pain locations.\n2. The response states, \"Pain is localized to knee and thigh, but not to foot,\" which contradicts the INPUT data that specifies pain in the dorsal aspect of both feet.\n3. Furthermore, the conclusion that the most probable diagnosis is \"Chagas\" is not well supported by the evidence provided. The symptoms described do not align with typical Chagas disease manifestations, which do not include the combination of pain and swelling in the described areas.\n4. The consideration of the other options (Localized edema and Anaphylaxis) was not thoroughly evaluated in relation to the INPUT data.\n\nDue to these inconsistencies, gaps in logic, and inaccurate reasoning, the INITIAL RESPONSE is not coherent or logically consistent.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
