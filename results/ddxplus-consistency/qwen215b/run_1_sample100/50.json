Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 16\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain that improves when you lean forward?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - side of the neck(R)\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you regularly take stimulant drugs?\\n    - N\\nDo you have difficulty swallowing, or have a feeling of discomfort/blockage when swallowing?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that you produce more saliva than usual?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America\\nHave you noticed that the tone of your voice has become deeper, softer or hoarse?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Epiglottitis\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Larygospasm\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Chagas\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Viral pharyngitis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nAn 16-year-old male with pain that improves with leaning forward, related to his reason for consulting, and pain in the tonsil, side of the neck, pharynx, under the jaw, and tonsil. Pain is a knife stroke intensity, does not radiate, located 5 out of 10, and appears 3 out of 10. He does not take stimulant drugs, feels comfortable swallowing, experiences shortness of breath, has diabetes, rarely produces saliva, breathes through a high-pitched sound, has not traveled outside the U.S., and has a hoarse tone of voice.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nEpiglottitis: Pain improves with leaning forward, associated with throat pain and difficulty swallowing.\n\nMyasthenia gravis: Pain described, but typically affects the face and leads to difficulty swallowing.\n\nAcute laryngitis: Pain can improve with leaning forward, but not often.\n\nHIV (initial infection): Not typical symptoms.\n\nLarygospasm: Pain and associated breathing difficulties, but not leaning forward.\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Not typical symptoms.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome: Pain improves with leaning forward, but not often.\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Pain can improve with leaning forward, but not often.\n\nMyocarditis: Pain and difficulty breathing can be associated, but with no fever and no other symptoms.\n\nChagas: Not typical symptoms.\n\nPulmonary embolism: Not typical symptoms.\n\nScombroid food poisoning: Not typical symptoms.\n\nPSVT: Not typical symptoms.\n\nSLE: Not typical symptoms.\n\nAnaphylaxis: Pain improves with leaning forward, but not often.\n\nViral pharyngitis: Pain described, but often happens with fever and difficulty swallowing.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is Viral pharyngitis.\n\n```Viral pharyngitis```\n\nLABEL:\nEpiglottitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provides a detailed analysis, stating that the 16-year-old male does not experience pain improvement when leaning forward, contradicting the first sentence. It misstates that pain improves with leaning forward, an oversight given the explicit evidence.\n\nFurther, it misrepresents evidence by including symptoms not indicated in the INPUT: shortness of breath, diabetes, etc. These elements are not supported by initial information, leading to incorrect assumptions.\n\nDespite having a methodical approach and discussing each condition systematically, this oversight and information inconsistency significantly distort response consistency. Therefore, a PREDICTION decision is made.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
