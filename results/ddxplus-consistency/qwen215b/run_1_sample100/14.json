Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 45\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - mouth\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - nose\\n    - eye(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - back of head\\n    - nose\\n    - temple(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nHave you lost your sense of smell?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had pneumonia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have polyps in your nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a deviated nasal septum?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you more likely to develop common allergies than the general population?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 45-year-old female with sharp pain in her forehead, cheek(L), nose, eye(R), and a 3 on a scale of 1-10 for the intensity.

    "prediction": "The initial response's reasoning is inconsistent and contains several errors and contradictions. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Pain Localization and Radiation**: The input states that the pain is located in multiple areas (mouth, forehead, cheek, nose, and eye) and radiates to the back of the head and temples. However, the response incorrectly states that \"the pain does not radiate and is not localized to a particular region,\" which is a contradiction.\n\n2. **Pain Intensity**: The pain intensity was recorded as 2 out of 10, the response summarizes it as 3 out of 10. This discrepancy suggests improper consideration of the input information.\n\n3. **Diagnostic Options**: The response describes \"URTI\" as \"Urinary tract infection,\" which is incorrect. URTI typically refers to an Upper Respiratory Tract Infection. This misinterpretation of terminology indicates a significant error in the logical reasoning process.\n\n4. **Final Diagnosis**: The initial response concludes with Viral pharyngitis as the most likely diagnosis, yet mentions ‘sharp pain in the throat’ which was not specified in the inputs. The symptoms, based on the input, align more closely with sinus-related issues like Chronic Rhinosinusitis, often linked with facial pain. Furthermore, the response doesn't offer a logical explanation supporting the likelihood of Viral pharyngitis as the most probable diagnosis.\n\nGiven these multiple inconsistencies and the lack of a coherent rationale aligning with the provided symptoms and options, the rating of the INITIAL RESPONSE is:\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
