Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 68\\nSex: M\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - temple(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Influenza\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 68-year-old man without recent travel or close contact with others.

    "prediction": "INITIAL RESPONSE is inconsistent with the information given in the INPUT. The response indicates \"Only a sore throat,\" which contradicts the INPUT where the patient explicitly denies having a sore throat. Additionally, the reasoning in the INITIAL RESPONSE seems to misidentify URTI as \"Urinary tract infection\" instead of the intended \"Upper respiratory tract infection,\" leading to inappropriate discounting of that option. Consequently, this logical error affects the final diagnosis recommendation since the symptoms described (persistent localized pain without typical respiratory symptoms) don't immediately align with bronchitis and may be more consistent with a headache disorder or rhinosinusitis. Furthermore, the response lacks coherence as it misaligns the given symptoms with the detailed analysis of options.\n\nTherefore, the reasoning in the INITIAL RESPONSE contains significant gaps and logical errors, undermining its consistency and coherence.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
