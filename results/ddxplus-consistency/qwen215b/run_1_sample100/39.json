Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 24\\nSex: F\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Larygospasm'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 24-year-old female with no history of asthma or bronchodilator use.

    "prediction": "To evaluate the INITIAL RESPONSE for consistency:\n\n1. The INPUT provides a set of questions about symptoms and history, concluding with a diagnosis option: \"Larygospasm.\"\n2. The INITIAL RESPONSE attempts to eliminate each potential influencing factor for larygospasm based on the given evidence, systematically evaluating each symptom and history component.\n3. However, instead of confirming the likely diagnosis from the given \"options\" (which contains only \"Larygospasm\"), the response incorrectly concludes with a diagnosis of \"Oropharyngeal (Laryngopharyngeal) dysphagia,\" which is not listed as an option.\n4. This represents a logical inconsistency because, according to the INPUT, the evaluator should consider only \"Larygospasm,\" but it effectively introduces a new condition that was not listed, which does not logically follow from the provided evidence and options.\n5. There are significant gaps because the INITIAL RESPONSE introduces and favors a diagnosis not listed or supported by the given evidence or options.\n\nBased on these observations, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks logical consistency, as it diverges from the given options without adequate justification. Therefore, the evaluation should be:\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
