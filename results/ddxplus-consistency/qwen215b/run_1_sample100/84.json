Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 49\\nSex: M\\nHave you started or taken any antipsychotic medication within the last 7 days?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever felt like you were suffocating for a very short time associated with inability to breathe or speak?\\n    - N\\nHave you been treated in hospital recently for nausea, agitation, intoxication or aggressive behavior and received medication via an intravenous or intramuscular route?\\n    - N\\nDo you have trouble keeping your tongue in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hard time opening/raising one or both eyelids?\\n    - N\\nDo you have annoying muscle spasms in your face, neck or any other part of your body?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 49-year-old male without any symptoms or treatment history, indicating either no exposure to antipsychotic medications or a different diagnosis, consistent with a diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis.\n\n```Myasthenia gravis```\n\nLABEL:\nAcute dystonic reactions\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The given INITIAL RESPONSE lacks consistency and coherence in its reasoning. It concludes with a diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis without providing any logical reasoning that connects the evidence provided to this diagnosis. The evidence suggests that there are no symptoms like muscle spasms, or difficulty breathing, which are typical of Myasthenia Gravis, yet the response concludes with this as the diagnosis without explaining the reasoning process or any connection to the input data.\n\nMoreover, the reasoning does not address why the symptoms presented (or the lack thereof) are consistent with Myasthenia Gravis and does not explain why it might exclude Acute dystonic reactions, the correct label. The response fails to consider why the lack of antipsychotic medication use is significant for the differential diagnosis and how it contributes to ruling out or confirming specific conditions.\n\nThus, the initial response does not provide a well-structured, logical progression of thought or address the necessary logical steps to reach its conclusion. It lacks systematic analysis and methodical reasoning.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
