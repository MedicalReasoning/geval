Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 2\\nSex: M\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you had chills or shivers?\\n    - N\\nDo you have Parkinson’s disease?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had pneumonia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any lesions, redness or problems on your skin that you believe are related to the condition you are consulting for?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - pink\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - Y\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - side of the neck(L)\\n    - buttock(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - shoulder(R)\\n    - shoulder(L)\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - N\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had a loss of appetite or do you get full more quickly then usually?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nIs your BMI less than 18.5, or are you underweight?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pneumonia\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Influenza\\n- GERD\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Sarcoidosis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 2-year-old unvaccinated child with no cough, no pain, no fever, no shivers, and no alcohol use.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE has several inconsistencies and gaps in the reasoning process:\n\n1. **Lack of coherence with input evidence**: The initial response mentions a 2-year-old \"unvaccinated child\" with \"no rashes\", which contradicts the input evidence where there are several mentions of rashes with specific characteristics. This discrepancy suggests a significant gap in the usage of the input information.\n\n2. **Diagnosis Evaluation Flaws**: The response evaluates the likelihood of each disease but dismisses conditions like pneumonia, tuberculosis, and myocarditis as rare without considering any specific symptoms. This overlooks that pneumonia is still a potential diagnosis even at a young age, and the absence of a cough or fever doesn't entirely rule it out, especially given the chest-related symptoms described.\n\n3. **Selection of Diagnosis**: The conclusion that \"Bronchitis\" is the most probable diagnosis overlooks critical symptoms listed in the input, such as the presence of rashes and lack of respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough or shortness of breath), which aren't typical indicators of bronchitis, especially without cough.\n\n4. **Missing Logical Steps**: The initial response fails to connect the symptom of rash with the potential diagnoses, disregarding possibly more relevant options like 'Sarcoidosis,' which can be associated with skin manifestations.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks a coherent and complete examination of the reported symptoms in the context of potential diagnoses, leading to an unsupported conclusion.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
