Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 7\\nSex: F\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have trouble keeping your tongue in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hard time opening/raising one or both eyelids?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel that muscle spasms or soreness in your neck are keeping you from turning your head to one side?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you suddenly have difficulty or an inability to open your mouth or have jaw pain when opening it?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Anemia\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe patient is a 7-year-old female with symptoms including shortness of breath, difficulty keeping the tongue in the mouth, difficulty opening the eyelids, soreness in the neck, and jaw pain.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Symptoms match.\n\nPulmonary embolism: Less likely in a pediatric.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome: Typically seen in adults.\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Not typical in a child.\n\nMyocarditis: Not typical without clinical signs.\n\nAnemia: Not typical without treatment.\n\nAnaphylaxis: Not typical without specific symptoms.\n\nMyasthenia gravis: Not typical without symptoms.\n\nScombroid food poisoning: Not typical.\n\nPSVT: Not typical.\n\nSLE: Not typical.\n\nChagas: Not typical.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is Acute dystonic reactions.\n\n```Acute dystonic reactions```\n\nLABEL:\nAcute dystonic reactions\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The Initial Response is inconsistent because it states that the patient exhibits symptoms like shortness of breath, difficulty keeping the tongue in the mouth, difficulty opening the eyelids, soreness in the neck, and jaw pain, but the INPUT explicitly indicates that the patient answered \"No\" to all these symptom-related questions.

The reasoning fails to accurately address or reflect the evidence provided, leading to flawed conclusions. Hence, the rating is:\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
