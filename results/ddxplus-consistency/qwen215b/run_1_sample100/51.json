Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 17\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pericarditis\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- PSVT\\n- GERD\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Panic attack\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 17-year-old female with a pain characterized as a knife stroke in the breast (L side) with a sharpness, rated 4 out of 10 on a scale from 0 to 10. The pain does not radiate, is not precise, and does not appear suddenly. She feels no shortness of breath, is not experiencing palpitations, has not traveled recently, and the pain is not worse when lying down. The pain is alleviated when sitting up.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- Pericarditis: Uncommon in this age and gender, and the symptoms don't match.\n\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax: Occurs in the chest, not the breast.\n\n- Pulmonary embolism: Can cause shortness of breath and chest pain.\n\n- PSVT: Not common in this age.\n\n- GERD: Possible but not a sharp, localized pain.\n\n- Atrial fibrillation: Causes palpitations but not shortness of breath.\n\n- Myocarditis: Typically causes symptoms like fever and chest pain.\n\n- Panic attack: Fit with the sudden onset and sharp pain.\n\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome: Can cause sharp pain but not in the breast.\n\n- Boerhaave: Rare but not sharp pain.\n\n- Scombroid food poisoning: Not sharp and not in the breast.\n\n- Acute dystonic reactions: Not sharp.\n\n- Myasthenia gravis: Can cause pain but not in the breast.\n\n- Anemia: Not sharp.\n\n- Sarcoidosis: Not sharp.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is Panic attack.\n\n```Panic attack```\n\nLABEL:\nPericarditis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inconsistencies and errors. It inaccurately summarizes and misinterprets the patient's symptoms and test inputs. First, it wrongly states that the pain does not radiate, which contradicts the input stating that the pain radiates to the posterior chest wall. It also incorrectly interprets the pain's characteristics, as described in the input, and ignores specific pain locations provided (\"breast (L)\" and \"epigastric\"). Moreover, it misinterprets the scenario related to the relief or worsening conditions of the pain. Another error is made when it describes pain being alleviated when sitting up, incorrect and not mentioned in the input. Thus, the step-by-step logic used to eliminate the other potential diagnoses is flawed due to errors in understanding multiple input aspects. As a result, the logical flow is disturbed.\n\nThe candidate diagnoses are not evaluated adequately considering the various pieces of evidence, resulting in inconsistent reasoning. Therefore, the conclusion arrived at is logically flawed.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
