Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 50\\nSex: F\\nDo you have swollen or painful lymph nodes?\\n    - N\\nHave you lost consciousness associated with violent and sustained muscle contractions or had an absence episode?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - finger (ring finger)(R)\\n    - finger (little finger)(R)\\n    - finger (index)(R)\\n    - finger (middle)(R)\\n    - finger (middle)(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - NA\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - N\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - N\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you work in agriculture?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Sarcoidosis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Pulmonary embolism'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 50-year-old female with bilateral painful swollen lymph nodes, loss of consciousness, and associated pain in her fingers.

It inaccurately mentions \"bilateral painful swollen lymph nodes\" and \"loss of consciousness,\" both of which contradict the information in the INPUT, where the patient reports no swollen lymph nodes and no loss of consciousness. Additionally, the response does not properly analyze the symptoms listed, specifically the mild pain in the fingers without referencing any option related to muscle contractions. Furthermore, the conclusion seems to rely on the misinterpretation of symptoms which were not present, leading to the incorrect diagnosis of \"Acute dystonic reactions.\" Ultimately, the reasoning does not properly account for the actual symptoms presented and therefore lacks consistency and coherence.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
