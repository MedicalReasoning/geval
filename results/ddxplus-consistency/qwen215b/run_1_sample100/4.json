Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 54\\nSex: M\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - occiput\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 54-year-old male with no recent contact with infected persons, living alone, no pain related to his reason for consulting, no pain in top of head, cheek(R), cheek(L), or occiput.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE presents a conclusion that URTI (Upper Respiratory Tract Infection) is the most probable diagnosis based on the provided symptoms and evidences. However, there are some inconsistencies and issues in logic and reasoning:\n\n1. The response inaccurately claims, \"A 54-year-old male with... no pain in top of head, cheek(R), cheek(L), or occiput.\" This contradicts the INPUT, where pain is described at these locations.\n2. The reasoning skips a thorough evaluation of each option against the symptoms listed in the INPUT. It mentions that URTI typically presents with fever and cough, but the patient does not show these symptoms.\n3. The rationale behind dismissing other options is not sufficiently backed by the listed symptoms. For instance, the response discounts cluster headache, Chagas, and anemia without addressing or correlating their key symptoms.\n4. The response suggests \"runs a clear runny nose,\" whereas the INPUT states, \"Do you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N.\"\n\nGiven these discrepancies and lack of thorough reasoning, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks consistency and contains gaps, logical errors, and unsupported assumptions. Therefore, it doesn't meet the criterion of being coherent and logically consistent.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
