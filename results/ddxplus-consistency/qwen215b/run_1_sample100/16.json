Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 27\\nSex: F\\nDo any members of your immediate family have a psychiatric illness?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a cramp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - iliac fossa(L)\\n    - pubis\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - belly\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with depression?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from chronic anxiety?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel lightheaded and dizzy or do you feel like you are about to faint?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are dying or were you afraid that you were about do die?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from fibromyalgia?\\n    - N\\nAre you feeling nauseous or do you feel like vomiting?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had numbness, loss of sensation or tingling, in both arms and legs and around your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are detached from your own body or your surroundings?\\n    - N\\nDo you currently, or did you ever, have numbness, loss of sensitivity or tingling anywhere on your body?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a head trauma?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Panic attack\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Anemia\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- GERD\\n- Inguinal hernia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Stable angina\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Chagas\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 27-year-old female with increased sweating, pain in the right side of the chest, and a cramp-like pain, which radiates to the iliac fossa.

The input states that the patient does not have increased sweating, yet the initial response incorrectly claims there is increased sweating. Additionally, the locations of the pain provided in the input do not match those in the response. Furthermore, the response mistakenly states that the patient has had a history of panic attacks and been diagnosed with HIV, although the input does not mention these. The final diagnosis of \"Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\" is also chosen without a logical progression from the symptoms and evidence given in the input. The response contains significant logical errors and inconsistencies, particularly in its failure to correctly interpret details from the input and to provide a rational basis for the chosen diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, based on these observations, the initial response cannot be evaluated as consistent.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
