Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 34\\nSex: M\\nHave you recently had a viral infection?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a pericarditis?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - thoracic spine\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pericarditis\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- PSVT\\n- GERD\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Panic attack\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 34-year-old male with a rapidly developing severe shoulder pain, characterized as a knife stroke in the upper chest.

    "prediction": "To evaluate the consistency of the initial response, let's examine its coherence and logical progression:\n\n1. **Introduction and Symptom Analysis**: The initial response begins with a summary of the patient's symptoms consistent with the given evidence, although there's a misstatement: the response states \"pain is felt when lying down,\" contradicting the evidence where lying down does not aggravate symptoms. This is a gap in consistency.\n\n2. **Evaluation of Conditions**:\n   - The evaluation of options is quite arbitrary without clear justification. For instance, pericarditis, which matches the label, is new and considered rare without explanation.\n   - Some conditions are dismissed without sufficient evidence from symptoms, such as pulmonary embolism and NSTEMI/STEMI, which could theoretically align with rapid symptom onset.\n   - GERD is dismissed based on acute presentation, appropriate logic.\n   - Anemia is incorrectly stated as a common cause of chest pain—this reflects an inconsistency.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion is inconsistent with its provided analysis: \"Acute dystonic reactions\" does not comprehensively fit analyzed symptoms, and this selection strangely seems abrupt given the prior dismissals. The rationale for this conclusion is not transparent.\n\nThe response fails to maintain logical consistency, with unjustified leaps in diagnostics, unwarranted assumptions, and failure to systematically address each provided symptom against possible diagnoses. Therefore, it does not meet the criterion of coherence and consistency.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
