Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 39\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed any new fatigue, generalized and vague discomfort, diffuse (widespread) muscle aches or a change in your general well-being related to your consultation today?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pericarditis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Myocarditis\\n- GERD\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- PSVT\\n- Panic attack\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Chagas\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 39-year-old female with pain (a knife stroke) in the right breast (L), feeling it, not radiating, not precise, and not fast.

    "prediction": "The initial response lacks consistency in its reasoning. The response describes the symptoms incorrectly, stating that the pain is in the \"right breast (L)\" instead of the correct location of \"breast(L)\" as mentioned in the INPUT. Additionally, it concludes with \"Panic attack\" as the most probable diagnosis without thoroughly evaluating the symptom profile for all options, including Myocarditis, which is the correct label. The analysis of other conditions, such as Acute pulmonary edema being tied uniquely to right-sided heart failure or mischaracterizing the descriptor \"knife stroke\" doesn't accurately or fully address the nuanced symptom presentation. The evaluation doesn't consistently follow through to the label provided, nor does it logically connect the symptoms to the diagnosis of a panic attack thoroughly when compared to the symptom intricacies of Myocarditis. Therefore, the reasoning is incomplete and contains gaps.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
