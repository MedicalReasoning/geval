Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 49\\nSex: M\\nHave any of your family members been diagnosed with cluster headaches?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - violent\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - eye(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel that your eyes produce excessive tears?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Cluster headache'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe patient presents with headache-like pain in the forehead, cheek (right and left), temple (left), and eye (right) with a 9/10 intensity, no radiating pain, located at a precise 8 (out of 10), and no excessive alcohol consumption or addiction.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nCluster headache: Fits the description with location of pain and intensity of 9/10.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is Cluster headache.\n\n```Cluster headache```\n\nLABEL:\nCluster headache\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

It correctly identifies that the patient reports headache-like pain and evaluates the possibility of it being a cluster headache. \n\nHowever, there are inconsistencies and gaps in the reasoning:\n1. It notes the patient has a headache-like pain but does not fully explore other potential causes or conditions outside of naming cluster headaches.\n2. The response does not sufficiently elaborate on why the specific symptoms (haunting pain, violent character of the pain, tears, etc.) fit or do not fit with a cluster headache diagnosis.\n3. The INITIAL RESPONSE does not address all symptoms such as the nature of pain (haunting and violent) or consider any typical cluster headache features like eye tearing up or nasal congestion, which could be relevant.\n4. It presents a conclusion hastily without a thorough examination of all the symptoms against the potential conditions it considers.\n\nIn conclusion, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks a full exploration and methodical analysis of all aspects of the symptoms presented, leading to gaps in logic and inconsistency. Therefore, it does not satisfactorily meet the criterion of Consistency.\n\nPREDICTION```No```"
