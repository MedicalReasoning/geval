Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 57\\nSex: F\\nHave you been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known heart defect?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating very irregularly or in a disorganized pattern?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that are increased with physical exertion but alleviated with rest?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Atrial fibrillation\\n- PSVT\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Panic attack\\n- Anemia\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 57-year-old female without known heart valve issues, COPD, or previous heart issues, who experienced shortness of breath and slight dizziness.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE evaluates the information incorrectly, stating that the individual experienced symptoms not present in the given evidence. For example, it mentions the patient experiencing shortness of breath, slight dizziness, and irregular heartbeats, while the INPUT clearly indicates that these symptoms are not present. This misinterpretation leads to an incorrect analysis of the conditions listed.\n\nAdditionally, the reasoning provided fails to address all potential diagnostic options and lacks logical coherence. For instance, several options are incorrectly described or dismissed without proper justification, such as the misunderstanding of PSVT (\"Pectus Sternal Vibra Triae\") and a flawed step-by-step elimination approach. Furthermore, the final conclusion of a Panic attack does not align with the provided evidence list, and also contradicts the given correct label of Atrial fibrillation.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE contains logical inconsistencies and gaps, leading to an unsupported conclusion. Hence, it does not meet the criterion's requirements for Consistency.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
