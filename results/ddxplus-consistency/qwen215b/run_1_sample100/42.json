Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 49\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - sensitive\\n    - tugging\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\n    - hypochondrium(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hiatal hernia?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had stools that were black (like coal)?\\n    - N\\nDo you think you are pregnant or are you currently pregnant?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- GERD\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Anemia\\n- Stable angina\\n- Boerhaave'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 49-year-old female with chest pain that starts in her stomach and makes it feel like coal.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not logically connect the evidence with the final diagnosis of Pericarditis. The INPUT data explicitly mentions a lack of a burning sensation starting in the stomach and moving to the throat, which contradicts the description of GERD typically causing such symptoms. The INITIAL RESPONSE mistakenly states that there are no other symptoms beyond chest pain and inconsistently describes this pain as feeling like coal, despite the INPUT denying recent black stools. The approach to analyzing the options seems superficial and lacks depth. The response dismisses GERD without justifiable reasoning, overlooks specifics regarding the precise nature and location of the pain, and incorrectly concludes Pericarditis as the most likely diagnosis with no supporting evidence in the description. \n\nMoreover, the initial response completely neglects to evaluate the pain characteristics, intensity, and speed of onset supplied in the INPUT, which are critical details. The quick dismissal of GERD and incorrect assumptions about the presenting symptomatology point to a significant lack of completeness and coherence in the reasoning process. Overall, the logical path and structure are not methodical or consistent with the evidence provided.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
