Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 97\\nSex: M\\nDo you have chest pain even at rest?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a spontaneous pneumothorax?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heartbreaking\\n    - violent\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - breast(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nHave any of your family members ever had a pneumothorax?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that are increased with physical exertion but alleviated with rest?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Unstable angina\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Stable angina\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Panic attack\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\n```Spontaneous pneumothorax```\n\nThe patient is a 97-year-old male with chest pain at rest and no previous history of chest pain or pneumothorax. The pain is described as \"heartbreaking\" and is centered in the left chest, with no radiating pain. The intensity of the pain is rated as 7 out of 10. The pain does not radiate, nor does it affect shortness of breath or breathing. There are no risk factors for other conditions (aging, smoking, travel, family history, etc.). The pain is not increased by physical exertion or alleviated by rest, nor does it occur when breathing deeply. The pain is not related to other conditions that are more concerning (angina, coronary events, heart failure, myocarditis, etc.). The patient is not experiencing any acute conditions that are life-threatening or need immediate medical attention.\n\nLABEL:\nSpontaneous pneumothorax\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE suggests \"Spontaneous pneumothorax\" as the diagnosis. However, the explanation provided in the INITIAL RESPONSE does not align well with this conclusion. The evidence from the input indicates that the patient is not experiencing shortness of breath or has a history of pneumothorax, which are significant indicators for spontaneous pneumothorax. Furthermore, the INITIAL RESPONSE brings up factors that are not relevant or incorrect, such as the patient having no chest pain at rest, even though the input indicates otherwise. Additionally, the response states the pain centers in the left chest, whereas the input states it's in the right breast. Overall, the reasoning lacks a logical and coherent connection to the evidence given, leading to a conclusion not strongly supported by the facts.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
