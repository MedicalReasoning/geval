Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The initial response lacks consistency and coherence in its reasoning. Firstly, the analysis begins by incorrectly summarizing the patient's symptoms, stating that the chest pain is not severe and not radiating, whereas the input clearly describes the pain as severe (intensity of 10) and radiating (to the posterior chest wall). Additionally, the response fails to logically connect the diagnosed condition, \"Bronchitis,\" to the symptoms provided. Bronchitis is generally associated with coughing and possibly chest discomfort but not with severe, sharp, and precisely located chest pain as described in the input.\n\nMoreover, the response contains contradictions and oversights. For instance, it mentions \"Pulmonary embolism: Rare, not typically sharp,\" which does not justify dismissing pulmonary embolism entirely, especially given the severe chest pain without respiratory symptoms (like shortness of breath), which could still be indicative of such a condition. The immediate leap to diagnosing \"Bronchitis\" without addressing the presence or absence of symptoms typically associated with bronchitis – such as a bad cough or respiratory issues – demonstrates a lack of thorough reasoning.\n\nOverall, the response contains logical gaps, misinterpretation of symptoms, and unsupported assumptions, leading to an inaccurate conclusion. Thus, the evaluation of the Initial Response with respect to the criterion of Consistency must be negative.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
