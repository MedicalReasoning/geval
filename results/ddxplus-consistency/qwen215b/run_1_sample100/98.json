Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 61\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - upper chest\\n    - pharynx\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- GERD\\n- Influenza\\n- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe patient is 61 years old and reports pain on the side of the chest, upper chest, and pharynx.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates significant inconsistencies and logical inaccuracies. The response attempts to reach a diagnosis by rapidly dismissing or supporting various conditions without a consistent methodology or alignment with the provided evidence. For instance, the response suggests that the symptoms fit with bronchitis and a few other conditions like acute COPD exacerbation and unstable angina, despite the absence of a cough and other related symptoms commonly associated with these conditions. Furthermore, the acknowledgment of certain conditions fitting the symptoms is followed by listing them as \"Introduces [condition] as the initial diagnosis,\" creating confusion about which condition is prioritized or deemed more likely. It fails to justify why bronchitis was chosen over other more fitting conditions, missing a thorough step-by-step elimination or prioritization of differentials. The logic is inconsistent as it oscillates between various diagnoses without clear justification, leading to a misaligned conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the coherence and logical consistency of the INITIAL RESPONSE are lacking.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
