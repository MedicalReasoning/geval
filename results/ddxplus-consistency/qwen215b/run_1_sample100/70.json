Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 23\\nSex: M\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 23-year-old male with no history of contact, no living with multiple people, no pain related to the reason for consulting, no sensitive/nerve pain, no tonsil, thyroid cartilage, or pharynx pain, no jaw pain, no radiating pain, no precise location, no speed of onset, no nasal congestion, no travel, and no signs of a heart problem.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE has significant inconsistencies when compared to the evidence provided in the INPUT. Firstly, the response states that there is \"no pain related to the reason for consulting,\" which contradicts the provided evidence that mentions various locations of pain and characterizes it as sensitive and burning with an intensity of 7. The response also inaccurately summarizes the symptoms by saying \"no tonsil, thyroid cartilage, or pharynx pain,\" even though the evidence explicitly lists pain in these areas.\n\nAdditionally, the assertion that the patient \"does not have symptoms of laryngitis\" and that the symptoms are \"consistent with possible NSTEMI / STEMI\" lacks a clear logical basis, especially given the absence of classical cardiac symptoms such as chest pain, which is not mentioned in the provided evidence. The evidence suggests symptoms more aligned with throat-related or upper respiratory issues rather than cardiac issues.\n\nThe response also fails to address why \"Viral pharyngitis\" is dismissed when the symptoms provided, such as throat pain and burning characteristic, could align more with a viral infection than with cardiac conditions. Therefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE is not methodically consistent or logically coherent, as it misinterprets the evidence and does not provide a thorough analysis.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
