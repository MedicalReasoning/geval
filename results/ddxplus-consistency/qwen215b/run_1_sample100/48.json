Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 59\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - mouth\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - nose\\n    - eye(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - back of head\\n    - nose\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you lost your sense of smell?\\n    - N\\nHave you had a cold in the last 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have polyps in your nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you have greenish or yellowish nasal discharge?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your vaccinations up to date?\\n    - N\\nAre you more likely to develop common allergies than the general population?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 59-year-old female with mouth, cheek, nose, eye pain, fever, loss of smell, past history of polyps, asthma, green nasal discharge, and no recent travel.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAcute rhinosinusitis: Severe, possibly accompanied by fever.\n\nChronic rhinosinusitis: Usually non-severe.\n\nAcute laryngitis: Larynx pain, not nose.\n\nChagas: Rare in developed countries and not often associated with nasal symptoms.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is Acute rhinosinusitis.\n\n```Acute rhinosinusitis```\n\nLABEL:\nAcute rhinosinusitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly summarizes the key symptoms and background information provided in the INPUT. For example, it mentions fever, loss of smell, past history of polyps, asthma, and green nasal discharge, yet the INPUT clearly states that there is no fever, no loss of smell, no past polyps or asthma, and no green nasal discharge. These errors demonstrate a substantial lack of consistency in how the response translates evidence provided in the INPUT into the rationale leading to the diagnosis.\n\nMoreover, the response does not logically address the likelihood of each condition based on the factual details given. It only provides a surface-level discussion of each condition and does not align this discussion with the fixed checklist of symptoms and context provided in the INPUT. This causes confusion and undermines the decision for a diagnosis of Acute rhinosinusitis.\n\nThus, the response lacks coherence and logical consistency necessary to be classified as thorough and methodical.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
