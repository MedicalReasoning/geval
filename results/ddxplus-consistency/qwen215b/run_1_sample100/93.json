Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 2\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - pharynx\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Influenza\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Allergic sinusitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- URTI\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Croup\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 2-year-old male with a burning pain on the side of the chest.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains some inconsistencies and gaps in reasoning. Let's evaluate it based on the criterion:\n\n1. The patient is a 2-year-old male with a burning pain in the side of the chest. The REVIEW disregards \"Viral pharyngitis\" as it does not typically present as chest pain, it's more associated with throat discomfort rather than localized chest pain.\n2. The initial response rejects \"Bronchitis\" because they incorrectly associate it strictly with cough, while it could still be present without significant cough especially in toddlers where symptoms can be atypical.\n3. The summary analysis inaccurately notes a lack of cough as a strong disqualifier for conditions like bronchitis, which can sometimes manifest without a pronounced cough in a patient of this age.\n4. The review provides numerous options that do not directly address input symptoms like the very specific nature of pain described in the evidence.\n\nDue to these gaps in clinical deduction—disregarding relevant information regarding common pediatric presentations of the diseases mentioned and misinterpretation of the available symptoms—the response does not exhibit full coherence required by the task. The logic and step-by-step evaluation provided fails to bind deductions seamlessly to the condition meeting the label (bronchitis).\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
