Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 77\\nSex: M\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - sensitive\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - temple(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Influenza\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 77-year-old male who does not live with four or more people. He describes his pain as tedious and feels it in his temple, with the pain localized to the top of his head, 2 on a 1-10 scale. The pain does not radiate. He does not have a fever or a sore throat.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE evaluates the symptoms presented in the INPUT and attempts to match them with the provided diagnostic options. However, there are inconsistencies and leaps in logic:\n\n1. The INITIAL RESPONSE suggests that the chest pain is unrelated to lung or respiratory diseases, even though no chest pain is mentioned in the INPUT. This is a logical inconsistency.\n\n2. The conclusion that URTI (Upper Respiratory Tract Infection) is the most likely diagnosis contradicts the given symptoms. An URTI typically involves symptoms like a sore throat, nasal congestion, or a cough, none of which are present according to the INPUT.\n\n3. The reasoning that \"URTI...is common and not related to the other options\" does not hold logically since \"common\" does not account for the mismatch of symptoms. Additionally, Chronic Rhinosinusitis and certain other conditions listed may show some commonality with tedious pain, so dismissing them without explanation is a gap.\n\nOverall, the response lacks logical consistency in its evaluation of symptoms and options, leading to an unsupported conclusion.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
