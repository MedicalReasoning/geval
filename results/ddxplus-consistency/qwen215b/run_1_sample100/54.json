Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 67\\nSex: F\\nDo you have chest pain even at rest?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a spontaneous pneumothorax?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heartbreaking\\n    - violent\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - breast(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that are increased with physical exertion but alleviated with rest?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- GERD\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 67-year-old female without any known history of spontaneous pneumothorax, no chest pain at rest, no pain related to her condition, no pain in specific locations, no pain radiating, no pain intensity, no pain location, no pain speed, no smoking history, no recent travel, no symptoms related to physical exertion, and no previous history of chest pain.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nUnstable angina: Unlikely due to the absence of chest pain.\n\nStable angina: Unlikely due to the absence of chest pain and no previous history.\n\nPossible NSTEMI / STEMI: Unlikely due to the absence of chest pain.\n\nGERD: Common cause of chest pain but not with such symptoms.\n\nPericarditis: Unlikely due to the absence of chest pain.\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Unlikely due to the absence of chest pain.\n\nSpontaneous pneumothorax: Likely because of the chest pain described and the absence of any other symptoms.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is Spontaneous pneumothorax.\n\n```Spontaneous pneumothorax```\n\nLABEL:\nSpontaneous pneumothorax\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The initial response exhibits several logical inconsistencies and inaccuracies in interpreting the input data:\n\n1. The response incorrectly states that there is an absence of chest pain, whereas the evidence indicates very intense pain (rated 8 out of 10) described as \"heartbreaking\" and \"violent\" in the lower chest, side of the chest (R), upper chest, and both breasts.\n2. It ignores relevant evidence such as the location and intensity of the pain, the nature of the pain, and how quickly it appeared.\n3. Spontaneous pneumothorax is noted as \"likely\" at the end without proper justification, especially when the user denied having ever experienced such a condition.\n4. Many of the dismissal reasons for other conditions rests on incorrectly asserting there is no chest pain, which contradicts the evidence.\n\nThe initial response overlooks or misinterprets critical elements of the evidence, leading to a conclusion that does not logically follow from the information provided. Thus, the reasoning lacks coherence and is not thorough. The dismissal of other diagnoses and the argument for spontaneous pneumothorax without adequate basis reflect significant gaps in logic.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
