Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 80\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Influenza\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Boerhaave\\n- GERD\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Chagas\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think through this step-by-step. \n\n- The patient is a 80-year-old woman with pain on the side of the chest (R) and feeling of burning.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates several inconsistencies and logical misinterpretations:\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of Pain Information**: The input states that the patient feels pain on the \"side of the chest(R)\", \"side of the chest(L)\", \"upper chest\", and \"breast(L)\". However, the response inaccurately mentions that \"She does not feel pain anywhere else,\" indicating a misunderstanding of the input.\n\n2. **Intensity Misinterpretation**: The response incorrectly states that a pain intensity rated as 5 indicates the pain is \"extremely intense.\" In most scales, a 5 would be moderate, not extreme.\n\n3. **Incorrect Interpretation of the Time Frame**: The input does not specify that the pain occurred \"2 days ago,\" as mentioned in the response. The value '2' is under the category \"How fast did the pain appear?\" and not the duration.\n\n4. **Assumptions About History**: The response claims the patient does not have a history of heart conditions or gastrointestinal issues, but this information is not explicitly mentioned in the input.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits several misinterpretations and assumptions that lead to its recommendation of \"no specific diagnosis,\" which lacks logical cohesion given the provided symptoms and available diagnostic options. As a result, the INITIAL RESPONSE falls short of meeting the criterion for Consistency.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
