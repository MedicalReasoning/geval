Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 4\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Croup\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 4-year-old girl with pain on the side of the chest, characterized as burning.

She does not have a cough that produces more than usual sputum, and her cough did not result in a fever. She has not traveled out of the country or noticed wheezing sounds.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE is not consistent in its reasoning for several reasons:\n\n1. The response misinterprets the INPUT data. It states, \"She does not feel the pain anywhere,\" whereas the INPUT clearly indicates she feels pain on the right side of the chest, left breast, and posterior left chest wall.\n\n2. The analysis of \"Pneumonia\" is inconsistent. The response concludes it is the most likely diagnosis despite acknowledging that the lack of fever and sputum makes pneumonia less typical for this case. This contradicts the supporting evidence needed for pneumonia.\n\n3. The omission or misstatement of key factors such as the specific locations of the pain or other details results in a logical disconnect in reasoning, leading to an erroneous conclusion.\n\nOverall the explanation does not logically support the initial conclusion provided, showing a direct inconsistency with the actual findings from INPUT.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
