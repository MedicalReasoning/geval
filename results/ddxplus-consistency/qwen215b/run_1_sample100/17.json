Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several contradictions and logical inconsistencies. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. The input evidence clearly mentions the absence of a sore throat and cough, which are widely recognized as symptoms of an Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI). Despite noting these absences, the response ultimately concludes in favor of a URTI diagnosis, which is contradictory given the usual symptomatic requirements for URTI.\n  \n2. The analysis seems superficial and relies on hasty dismissals rather than thorough evaluations. For instance, it casually dismisses cluster headaches without addressing the detailed pain location description (top of head, forehead, cheeks, occiput) provided in the input, which might align with some symptoms of cluster headaches.\n\n3. The initial response asserts 'no history' for Chagas and anemia, but without any supportive evidence or reasoning from the input provided. These conditions may or may not manifest similarly to the symptoms described, and the dismissal lacks deeper investigation.\n\nOverall, the response doesn't methodically address each symptom reported in conjunction with the given options, leading to gaps in logic and an unsupported final conclusion.\n\nTherefore, based on these inconsistencies, the prediction should be:\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
