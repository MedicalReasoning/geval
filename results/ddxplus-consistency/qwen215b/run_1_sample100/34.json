Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 39\\nSex: F\\nAre you infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nAre you currently using intravenous drugs?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you had an involuntary weight loss over the last 3 months?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myocarditis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 39-year-old female with no history of coughing up blood and no fever, stating she is not using intravenous drugs or drinking alcohol excessively, with no weight loss, coughing, or fever.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nPulmonary neoplasm: Rare.\n\nTuberculosis: Known to cause fever and cough.\n\nBronchitis: Commonly presents with cough.\n\nPneumonia: Commonly associated with fever.\n\nHIV (initial infection): Has no typical symptoms.\n\nBronchiectasis: Chronic bronchitis.\n\nAcute pulmonary edema: Rare.\n\nPulmonary embolism: Can cause sudden shortness of breath.\n\nBronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation: May cause shortness of breath.\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Non-specific.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome: Rare.\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Unlikely without fever.\n\nMyocarditis: Common in inflammation and infection.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is HIV (initial infection).\n\n```HIV (initial infection)```\n\nLABEL:\nTuberculosis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE evaluates the patient's symptoms and the provided medical options systematically, following a clear reasoning path by ruling out other conditions due to the absence of specific symptoms such as fever, cough, or history of intravenous drug use. However, the conclusion that \"HIV (initial infection)\" is the most probable diagnosis seems unsupported given the inputs. The initial response overlooks the possibility of another condition being asymptomatic or presenting atypically, like Tuberculosis, which could occasionally present without classic symptoms. It's important that the reasoning considers overlap and variability in symptom presentation. Therefore, based on the criterion provided and the significant gap in logic regarding the final conclusion, the initial response lacks coherence in its final diagnosis alignment with the provided label, Tuberculosis.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
