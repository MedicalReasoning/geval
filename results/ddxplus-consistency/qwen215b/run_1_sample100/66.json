Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 20\\nSex: M\\nHave any of your family members been diagnosed with cluster headaches?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - tugging\\n    - violent\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - eye(L)\\n    - temple(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you feel that your eyes produce excessive tears?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Cluster headache\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 20-year-old male with no family history of cluster headaches or pain related to his reason for consultation.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE inaccurately concludes with a diagnosis without cohesively tying the provided symptoms to a diagnosis. Specifically, the symptoms provided do not seem to coherently or logically align directly with the diagnosis of \"Cluster headache.\" The response's analysis of options is insufficient and lacks thorough reasoning; it incorrectly lists properties and misconceptions like \"Malignant,\" \"persistent,\" and \"self-limiting\" for Cluster headaches, which are not characterized as 'malignant,' nor typically self-limiting. Furthermore, it does not account for the lengthy list of negative findings, like the absence of tearing or nasal symptoms, which are often associated with Cluster headaches. \n\nThe decision-making here appears disjointed and relies on assumptions that are unsupported by the data provided. The overview of the conditions and their attributes is weak with leaps in logic, particularly with dismissing Chagas based on rarity without supporting evidence or reasoning and inadequately excluding other possibilities, such as Anemia, without discussing whether it could relate to symptoms like sharp pain intensity or its exact localization. \n\nTherefore, considering the reasoning inconsistencies and the lack of a systematic approach, I must conclude:\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
