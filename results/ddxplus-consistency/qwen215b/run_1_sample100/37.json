Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 64\\nSex: M\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - pharynx\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that the tone of your voice has become deeper, softer or hoarse?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Influenza'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 64-year-old man describing his pain as burning, located in the tonsils, feels in the pharynx, is not radiating, is precise, and appears sudden.

    "prediction": "The initial response is mostly consistent, but with some minor issues. Let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. The evidence notes a burning pain in the tonsils and pharynx, with no associated fever, cough, or travel history, and the pain is localized and sudden. \n\n2. The response accurately rules out bronchitis, tuberculosis, and influenza based on symptom discrepancies such as the lack of cough, fever, or lung involvement.\n\n3. However, it quickly dismisses acute laryngitis, stating that burning pain is not typical. While acute laryngitis often involves hoarseness and may not always prominently feature burning pain, it wasn't thoroughly evaluated against the other symptoms described, such as the sudden onset and location of pain.\n\n4. Finally, the reasoning leads to the conclusion of viral pharyngitis as the most probable diagnosis because it involves the pharynx, which aligns with the symptoms.\n\nWhile the response presents a logical progression through the options, the dismissal of acute laryngitis isn't sufficiently substantiated given the evidenceâ€”particularly given that acute inflammation in the throat area could affect both the larynx and pharynx. This gap means the response did not consider all options as thoroughly as it should have, leading to a label mismatch.\n\nOverall, the response shows a logical flow but fails to completely engage with the input criteria when comparing acute laryngitis and viral pharyngitis. Thus, the initial response lacks full consistency. \n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
