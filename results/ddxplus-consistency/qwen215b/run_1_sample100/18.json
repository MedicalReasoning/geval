Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 48\\nSex: F\\nDo you have Rheumatoid Arthritis?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis (UC)?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had pneumonia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you immunosuppressed?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 48-year-old female presenting with symptoms of coughing up blood (negative for pneumonia, COPD, or other lung diseases), shortness of breath (negative for bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and bronchospasm/cough exacerbation), and anemia (negative for myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders).\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nBronchitis: May present with blood in sputum but usually due to inflammation.\n\nBronchiectasis: Involves atelectasis and hypoxemia.\n\nPneumonia: May cause cough and shortness of breath.\n\nPulmonary neoplasm: Can be diagnosed through imaging.\n\nAcute COPD exacerbation/infection: May present with shortness of breath.\n\nTuberculosis: Common in the upper respiratory tract.\n\nPulmonary embolism: Usually caused by a blood clot.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome: Rare.\n\nBronchospasm/acute asthma exacerbation: May be seen in asthmatics.\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Heart rhythm disorder.\n\nMyocarditis: Cardiac inflammation.\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Neurological.\n\nMyasthenia gravis: Muscle weakness.\n\nAnemia: Red blood cell problems.\n\nPSVT: Potential indication of a cardiac issue.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is **Tuberculosis**.\n\n```Tuberculosis```\n\nLABEL:\nBronchiectasis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE shows a mix of inaccuracies and inconsistencies with the provided INPUT and evidences. The response briefly lists possible conditions but fails to correctly match or address all diagnostic criteria related to the symptoms and evidences listed. Crucially, the symptoms mentioned in the initial response do not align with the INPUT evidences, leading to a significant logical gap.\n\n1. The INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly mentions the patient presenting with symptoms of coughing up blood, shortness of breath, and anemia, while the INPUT explicitly states these symptoms are absent (i.e., the patient reported \"N\" for coughing up blood and shortness of breath).\n\n2. The reasoning provided in the INITIAL RESPONSE does not consider that the patient has no history of pneumonia, COPD, or other conditions specified in the INPUT as negative. These should be directly considered against the available options.\n\n3. The conclusion that \"Tuberculosis\" is the most probable diagnosis contradicts the fact that the INPUT states the patient has \"N\" for coughing up blood (a common indicator for TB) and \"N\" for immunosuppression, travel, and other factors typically considered for Tuberculosis risk.\n\nThus, the reasoning lacks consistency and coherence, presenting a conclusion that does not logically follow from the given data.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
