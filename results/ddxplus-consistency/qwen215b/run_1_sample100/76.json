Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 25\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your vaccinations up to date?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms more prominent at night?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Allergic sinusitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- GERD\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- URTI\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Influenza\\n- Stable angina\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe patient is a 25-year-old male with a burning pain in the lower chest.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly assesses the symptoms and jumps to a diagnosis without thoroughly considering all provided symptoms. The response inaccurately states the patient's symptoms, mentioning difficulty in breathing when exhaling and nighttime prominence of symptoms, which are not supported by the input data. These inaccuracies lead to flawed reasoning and an illogical progression to the conclusion of Unstable angina.\n\nAdditionally, the interpretation of disease characteristics such as \"GERD may cause heartburn but not chest pain\" and various other conditions is not consistent with typical medical understanding. GERD can indeed cause chest pain often described as heartburn.\n\nUltimately, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not effectively use the information provided and misidentifies the most likely condition as Unstable angina, resulting in a conclusion that is logically inconsistent with the data suggesting Bronchitis, particularly given the burning chest pain and no significant respiratory symptoms or risk factors for angina.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
