Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE has a few inconsistencies and gaps in reasoning. Here's why:\n\n1. The response seems to misunderstand the data presented in the input. Despite stating that the subject reports no pain, the evidence clearly mentions intense pain (scoring 10) in multiple locations, including lower chest, side of the chest, and breasts, with radiating pain. This is a significant oversight and contradicts the information provided.\n\n2. It suggests that some conditions (like GERD and Panic attack) are rare in this age group without supporting evidence. GERD is not age-specific, and panic attacks can occur at any age, including young adults.\n\n3. The reasoning around age appropriateness for conditions lacks detailed justification. For instance, while SLE can occur in young adults, the logic used to arrive at Sarcoidosis over other potentially fitting conditions like panic attacks or GERD isn't well articulated.\n\n4. The conditions listed as \"Rare in this age group\" seem rather arbitrary without consideration of symptomatology.\n\nThese inconsistencies point to a lack of methodical approach in interpreting the condition based on available symptoms. The response should have matched symptoms more tightly with potential diagnoses, using logical steps to narrow down possibilities, and acknowledged or explained the intense pain symptoms given.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
