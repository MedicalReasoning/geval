Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 49\\nSex: F\\nDo you have an active cancer?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - scapula(R)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you currently take hormones?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - nowhere\\nDid you lose consciousness?\\n    - N\\nHave you had surgery within the last month?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America', 'options': '- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Panic attack\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Ebola\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 49-year-old female with symptoms of coughing up blood, pain on the side of the chest, sensitivity to pain, and shortness of breath.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inaccuracies and inconsistencies:\n\n1. The initial response misinterprets some input symptoms. The INPUT explicitly states that there is no coughing up blood and no significant shortness of breath, but the INITIAL RESPONSE mentions these symptoms incorrectly as present.\n   \n2. The analysis of potential conditions is not thorough. For instance, when considering pulmonary embolism, the response notes leg swelling is absent, which is correct from the INPUT, but this does not conclude why it rules out or supports pulmonary embolism.\n\n3. The conclusion that \"The most probable diagnosis is Acute pulmonary edema\" is not explained or directly supported by reasoning related to the specific symptoms in the context provided (e.g., no significant breathing difficulty was reported, which is a key symptom for acute pulmonary edema).\n\n4. The evidence and symptoms presented in the INPUT lean more towards pulmonary embolism given the provided symptom of chest pain that radiates, yet the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to connect this appropriately to the possible options.\n\nDue to these issues, the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates inconsistencies and gaps in logical reasoning by making incorrect assumptions about symptoms and drawing a conclusion not supported by the INPUT.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
