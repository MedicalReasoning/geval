Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 55\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - palace\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 55-year-old female with no history of similar symptoms in the last 2 weeks, living alone, attending a daycare, mild pain in her tonsils (tonsil(R) or tonsil(L)), and a burning pain localized to her jaw.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inconsistencies and logical gaps in its reasoning:\n\n1. There is a misinterpretation in the term \"URTI.\" The input \"URTI\" should be understood as an Upper Respiratory Tract Infection, but the response interprets it as a \"Urinary Tract Infection,\" which is incorrect given the context.\n\n2. The response inaccurately states that the patient is attending daycare, whereas the input explicitly mentions that the patient does not attend or work in a daycare.\n\n3. The reasoning doesn't systematically evaluate the symptoms in relation to each diagnosis option, such as the mentioned pain in various locations like the tonsils and thyroid cartilage, which are relevant to conditions like viral pharyngitis.\n\n4. The response narrowly focuses on angina without thoroughly explaining why viral pharyngitis, which would be consistent with tonsil pain and burning sensations, is not considered the most probable diagnosis. The final choice of \"Stable angina\" does not align with the evidence.\n\nThese points highlight significant gaps and oversights in the reasoning process, leading to an inaccurate conclusion.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
