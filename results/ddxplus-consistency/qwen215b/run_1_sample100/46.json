Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 47\\nSex: F\\nDo you regularly take stimulant drugs?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever felt like you were suffocating for a very short time associated with inability to breathe or speak?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hard time opening/raising one or both eyelids?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you suddenly have difficulty or an inability to open your mouth or have jaw pain when opening it?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute dystonic reactions'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 47-year-old female who is not regularly taking stimulant drugs and has a history of fainting but no hard eyelid problems, no travel, and no sudden mouth opening difficulties.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Rare.

    "prediction": "To evaluate the INITIAL RESPONSE, we need to consider the logical flow and coherence based on the given INPUT.\n\n1. The INPUT provides evidence about a 47-year-old female with specific symptom-related queries, all answered 'No.' The main symptoms questioned include regular stimulant drug use, feeling of suffocation, difficulty with eyelid movement, recent travel history, and issues with jaw movement or pain.\n\n2. The INITIAL RESPONSE mentions a history of fainting, which is not specified in the INPUT. This is a clear inconsistency since the INPUT does not describe fainting as a concern or question. This suggests the introduction of unsupported assumptions or information outside of what is provided.\n\n3. The logic from the INITIAL RESPONSE in assessing potential diagnoses seems to focus solely on \"Acute dystonic reactions\" without bridging the evidence and symptoms consistently. The connection between the lack of symptoms and the diagnosis is too abrupt and lacks reasoning about why the other factors lead to this conclusion.\n\n4. The reference to stimulant drug use in relation to \"Acute dystonic reactions\" does not connect well with provided 'No' answers about drug use in the INPUT. Thus, not addressing precisely why the absence of all queried symptoms would suggest this diagnosis closely.\n\n5. Overall, there's a lack of thorough exploration of how these conclusions were methodically reached, lacking a step-by-step analysis addressing all aspects of the INPUT.\n\nThus, the response lacks consistency and coherence due to logical leaps and unsupported additions.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
