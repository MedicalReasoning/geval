Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 67\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - upper chest\\n    - pharynx\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your vaccinations up to date?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- URTI\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- GERD\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Panic attack\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Stable angina\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 67-year-old female with a sore throat, cough, and shortness of breath.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provided includes essential information regarding the patient's symptoms and possible diagnosis options. However, there are several inconsistencies and oversights:\n\n1. The INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly states that the patient has a sore throat, cough, and shortness of breath, while the INPUT clearly indicates 'N' (No) for sore throat, cough, and shortness of breath. This misinterpretation significantly affects the analysis.\n\n2. The statement that there is no pain in the chest, pharynx, posterior chest wall, or upper chest contradicts the INPUT which reports pain in several areas, although at a low intensity.\n\n3. Many options are dismissed or considered without adequate justification or reasoning concerning the patient's age, sympoms, and history provided in the INPUT.\n\nDue to these inconsistencies and logical gaps, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and accuracy in its reasoning based on the evidence provided in the INPUT.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
