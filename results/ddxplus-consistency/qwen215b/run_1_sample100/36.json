Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 10\\nSex: F\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDid your cheeks suddenly turn red?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any lesions, redness or problems on your skin that you believe are related to the condition you are consulting for?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - pink\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - N\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - biceps(R)\\n    - biceps(L)\\n    - mouth\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - ankle(R)\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - Y\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you feeling nauseous or do you feel like vomiting?\\n    - N\\nDid you eat dark-fleshed fish (such as tuna) or Swiss cheese before the reaction occurred?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 10-year-old with shortness of breath and difficulty breathing, and a red skin lesion.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not accurately reflect the given INPUT. The INPUT states that the individual is not experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. However, the response begins by stating the patient has shortness of breath and difficulty breathing, which is inconsistent with the presented evidence. Furthermore, the response makes incorrect assumptions about the size of the lesion and its symptoms, contradicting the evidence provided in the INPUT. The conclusions drawn in the INITIAL RESPONSE are based on these misinterpretations, leading to faulty reasoning.
