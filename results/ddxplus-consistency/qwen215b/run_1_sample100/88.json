Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 21\\nSex: M\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- PSVT\\n- Anemia\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 21-year-old male with no known heart valve issues, COPD, shortness of breath, diabetes, significant overweight, slight dizziness, and no heart attack history.

    "prediction": "The initial response has a significant issue with coherence and logical reasoning. It categorically dismisses Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) without offering a logical connection about why it is unrelated. It mentions anemia being common with COPD but does not relate it to the current patient who does not have COPD. The dismissals for myocardial conditions are not based on the provided symptoms. Furthermore, associating panic attacks with recent travel, without explaining the connection between travel history and panic attacks, is a leap in logic. Finally, the reasoning culminates in concluding \"panic attack,\" even though no symptoms related to it were presented. These logic gaps and unsupported assumptions indicate that the initial response lacks consistency. \n\nPREDICTION```No```"
