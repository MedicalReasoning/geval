Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 1\\nSex: F\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you had a cold in the last 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that the tone of your voice has become deeper, softer or hoarse?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute laryngitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Acute otitis media\\n- Epiglottitis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n```Acute laryngitis```\n\nThe other options do not fit the clinical presentation:\n\n- Bronchitis: Persistent cough, fever, and difficulty breathing are typical.\n- Pneumonia: Cough, fever, chest pain, and difficulty breathing are common.\n- Tuberculosis: Continuous cough and weight loss are typical.\n- Viral pharyngitis: Pain, hoarseness, and fever are typical.\n- Acute otitis media: Ear pain, hearing loss, and fever are typical.\n- Chagas: Deafness, abdominal pain, and fever are typical.\n\nLABEL:\nAcute laryngitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE evaluates the symptoms of the patient and reasonably concludes that \"Acute laryngitis\" is the most likely diagnosis. The response goes on to systematically exclude other possible diagnoses by listing their typical symptoms, which do not align with the presented symptoms of the patient, such as an absence of cough, fever, or hoarseness, and no symptoms such as ear pain, chest pain, abdominal pain, or weight loss. \n\nThe reasoning is consistent as it analyzes each condition step-by-step based on symptomatology, ruling out conditions that involve symptoms that the patient does not exhibit. However, there is a slight inconsistency in the symptomatology being mismatched for \"Chagas,\" since typical acute symptoms are not those mentioned, but rather chronic symptoms are listed. Despite this, given the overall logical exclusion of most other conditions and the fitting symptoms mentioned for acute laryngitis (pain at the thyroid cartilage and under the jaw), the conclusion is coherent. \n\nTherefore, the response is coherent and logical without any significant gaps or flawed logical leaps regarding the most likely condition, considering the symptoms. \n\n```PREDICTION```Yes```"
