Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 25\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - upper chest\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - nowhere\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 25-year-old female with sensitive, fixed pain on the side of the chest, especially the right, and a difficulty breathing when breathing deeply.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE to the task displays several inconsistencies and inaccuracies. First, it describes the patient's condition as having difficulty breathing when breathing deeply, whereas the input clearly states \"N\" for \"Do you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\" It notes that the patient has no shortness of breath, which is accurate according to the input. However, the conclusion that \"Pulmonary embolism: Not related to chest pain\" is incorrect, as pulmonary embolism can indeed be associated with chest pain, often sharp and possibly pleuritic (worsened by breathing). The reasoning for other conditions also appears oversimplified or inaccurate. For example, Myocarditis is said not to be associated with chest pain, which is misleading as myocarditis can involve chest pain. Furthermore, the initial response concludes that the most probable diagnosis is \"Acute dystonic reactions,\" despite these being typically characterized by muscle spasms rather than chest symptoms, which the input does not describe. Overall, the response lacks a logical, consistent approach to the information given and incorrectly analyzes or dismisses several important options. As such, it fails to provide a consistent or well-reasoned analysis.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
