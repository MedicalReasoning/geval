Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 63\\nSex: F\\nDo you feel anxious?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a cramp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - flank(L)\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are (or were) choking or suffocating?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with depression?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel lightheaded and dizzy or do you feel like you are about to faint?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a migraine or is a member of your family known to have migraines?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are dying or were you afraid that you were about do die?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from fibromyalgia?\\n    - N\\nAre you feeling nauseous or do you feel like vomiting?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had numbness, loss of sensation or tingling, in both arms and legs and around your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are detached from your own body or your surroundings?\\n    - N\\nDo you currently, or did you ever, have numbness, loss of sensitivity or tingling anywhere on your body?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Panic attack\\n- PSVT\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Anemia\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Stable angina\\n- GERD\\n- Inguinal hernia\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Chagas\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 63-year-old female who had a recent cholecystectomy and now feels anxious about her new lower chest pain.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE is inconsistent due to several reasons:\n\n1. The response introduces information not present in the input, such as the subject having had a recent cholecystectomy and feeling anxious, which contradicts the input where the subject does not feel anxious.\n\n2. The deductions for each medical condition seem arbitrary and lack coherent connections to the provided symptoms. There is an incorrect application of symptoms to conditions, such as associating conditions not mentioned in the symptoms provided.\n\n3. Although the final prediction of a Panic attack aligns with the LABEL, the steps leading to this conclusion are flawed and not substantiated by the input data. The response lacks logical reasoning connecting the input to the medical condition.\n\nThus, the response lacks coherence and logical consistency with unverifiable claims and unsupported reasoning.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
