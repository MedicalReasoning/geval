Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 35\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - side of the neck(R)\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - trachea\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high blood pressure or do you take medications to treat high blood pressure?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that the tone of your voice has become deeper, softer or hoarse?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Epiglottitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Larygospasm\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Unstable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 35-year-old female with throat pain (knife-like, sharp), pain localized to the tonsils, difficulty breathing, and no shortness of breath.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provided in the evaluation does not exhibit a clear and consistent reasoning process. The analysis contains contradictions and logical errors that undermine its coherence. \n\n1. In the response, throat pain is mentioned, yet the reasoning incorrectly states that acute laryngitis and viral pharyngitis, which are associated with sore throat, aren't relevant to throat pain.\n2. Furthermore, the assertion that pulmonary embolism, despite being tied more to shortness of breath than throat pain, is the most probable diagnosis is logically inconsistent considering the characterization of the symptoms and available options. Throat pain, especially localized, is more indicative of conditions like epiglottitis or viral pharyngitis rather than pulmonary issues.\n3. Additionally, the label given for the correct diagnosis is \"Epiglottitis,\" which wasn't even explored properly in the INITIAL RESPONSE beyond stating it's common in children. The response posits pulmonary embolism as the leading diagnosis, which directly contradicts the LABEL.\n\nOverall, given these inconsistencies and illogical conclusions drawn in light of the symptoms presented and the final diagnosis provided by the label, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not show consistency with its analysis.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
