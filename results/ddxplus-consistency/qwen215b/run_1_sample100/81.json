Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 73\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 73-year-old female with burning pain in the throat, tonsil, thyroid cartilage, and pharynx, located under the jaw, not radiating, and intense at 5. She has a cough but no fever, no travel history, and no recent contact with sick persons.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- Bronchitis: Pain in the throat is typical but not specific.\n- Viral pharyngitis: Pain in the throat is not typical for this.\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI: Pain can radiate but not intense.\n- Unstable angina: Pain in the throat is not typical.\n- Stable angina: Pain in the throat is not typical.\n\nThe pain is localized and intense, not radiating, and not typical for bronchitis, viral pharyngitis, or stable angina. It's much more consistent with viral pharyngitis. The intense, localized pain is likely to be a symptom of a viral infection.\n\n```Viral pharyngitis```\n\nLABEL:\nViral pharyngitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE seems to have some inconsistencies in reasoning while analyzing the symptoms and aligning them with the options provided. Let's go through the analysis:\n\n1. The evidence indicates the patient's age, sex, symptoms, and relevant background information such as pain characteristics and lack of travel or contacts.\n2. The INITIAL RESPONSE inaccurately notes that the patient's pain is intense at \"5\" when, in fact, the intensity is noted as \"3\" within the input; this seems like an oversight.\n3. Additionally, while the input states \"Do you have a cough? - N\", the INITIAL RESPONSE indicates \"She has a cough but no fever,\" which is a contradiction to the information provided.\n4. The analysis says viral pharyngitis is consistent even though it says \"Pain in the throat is not typical for this,\" which is also contradictory.\n\nDue to these inaccuracies and inconsistencies in evaluating the provided information, there are gaps in logic in the reasoning presented in the INITIAL RESPONSE. The logical flow is disrupted by inaccurate recall and analysis of the evidence presented, leading to unsupported conclusions.\n\nTherefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not meet the criterion due to these gaps and lacks a cohesive and logical reasoning path based on the provided inputs.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
