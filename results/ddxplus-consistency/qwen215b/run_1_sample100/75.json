Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 91\\nSex: F\\nAre you currently being treated or have you recently been treated with an oral antibiotic for an ear infection?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - ear(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nAre you more irritable or has your mood been very unstable recently?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your vaccinations up to date?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute otitis media'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nTo think step-by-step:\n\nGiven age and sex, the patient is elderly.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains inconsistencies and logical gaps. Here's an analysis of the response:\n\n1. The response begins by noting that the patient is elderly, which is correct, as the patient is 91 years old. However, it contradicts the provided evidence by stating that the patient \"is currently being treated or recently treated with an oral antibiotic for an ear infection,\" which is false according to the input. The input clearly states, \"N\" for being treated with an oral antibiotic for an ear infection.\n\n2. The INITIAL RESPONSE does not thoroughly engage with the input data regarding the patient's symptoms and condition. For example, it could further analyze the sharp, localized ear pain and the lack of fever to support or question the diagnosis of Acute otitis media.\n\n3. The response should also consider that the evidence denies recent antibiotic treatment and fever, two factors that could suggest a different approach to determining if acute otitis media is indeed the most appropriate diagnosis, yet it doesn't explore these aspects.\n\n4. The response concludes with a declaration of the diagnosis but doesn't provide a strong logical progression that considers all relevant information or potential differential diagnoses.\n\nThese points indicate that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence in its logic and doesn't thoroughly address the provided information. Therefore, based on the specified criterion, the evaluation is:\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
