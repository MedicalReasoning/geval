Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 46\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\n    - iliac fossa(L)\\n    - testicle(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have any lesions, redness or problems on your skin that you believe are related to the condition you are consulting for?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - pale\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - N\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\n    - iliac fossa(L)\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - Y\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHave you been able to pass stools or gas since your symptoms increased?\\n    - N\\nDo you have intense coughing fits?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America\\nAre the symptoms or pain increased with coughing, with an effort like lifting a weight or from forcing a bowel movement?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Inguinal hernia\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Whooping cough\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 46-year-old female with pain in the iliac fossa, heavy and not radiating.

    "prediction": "The initial response steps through the symptoms and options provided, but there are several inconsistencies and gaps in the reasoning:\n\n1. The response mentions \"rash in the same region with no lesions\" but contradicts the INPUT which describes a rash with a swelling intensity of 7, and lesions larger than 1 cm.\n\n2. It dismisses Inguinal hernia stating it is \"usually not painful,\" ignoring the symptoms of pain in the iliac fossa and inability to pass stools or gas, which could be indicative of a hernia.\n\n3. The response inaccurately assesses Anaphylaxis as the “most probable diagnosis,” despite the INPUT describing no intense skin symptoms like itching or breathing problems typical for Anaphylaxis.\n\n4. The choice of Scombroid food poisoning is disregarded without considering the presence of a rash, despite the INPUT suggesting symptoms that could match this condition (pain and rash).\n\n5. The conclusion is declared without a strong basis of reasoning linking Anaphylaxis as the actioned diagnosis despite symptoms suggesting another condition, such as Inguinal hernia or Scombroid poisoning, being more aligned.\n\nConsidering these inconsistencies and logical gaps, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks a coherent and consistent flow of reasoning.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
