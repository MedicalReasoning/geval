Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 2\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - occiput\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Influenza\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 2-year-old female presenting with fever, headache, and a sore throat.

    "prediction": "1. **Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE Carefully:**\n\n   - The **INPUT** provides a list of symptoms and factors, such as the patient being a 2-year-old female, with no contact with sick individuals, and no pain apart from a headache with intensity \"2.\" The subject experiences pain in various areas on the head but does not have a cough, sore throat, or nasal congestion.\n   - The **INITIAL RESPONSE** attempts to diagnose the condition by outlining symptoms and evaluating a set of potential diagnoses (URTI, Bronchitis, Pneumonia, etc.). It concludes that the most likely diagnosis is URTI.\n\n2. **Evaluate the INITIAL RESPONSE for Consistency:**\n\n   - The response introduces symptoms like \"fever\" and \"sore throat\" that do not appear in the INPUT evidence, leading to inconsistencies.\n   - The response mentions \"no history of joint pain, fever, or rash,\" but the INPUT does not discuss a lack of these symptoms.\n   - The evaluation of the conditions lacks a thorough step-by-step approach; many conclusions are stated without reasoning that aligns with the data in the INPUT.\n   - Misinterpretations of the available data (e.g., \"sore throat\" when there's a clear \"N\" response) show logical inconsistencies.\n\n3. **Output the INITIAL RESPONSE as Yes or No based on Consistency Criterion:**\n\n   - The INITIAL RESPONSE does not logically address the provided symptoms and incorrectly introduces symptoms not mentioned in the INPUT, leading to inconsistent reasoning.\n   - It fails to connect its conclusions methodically to the evidence, demonstrating significant gaps in reasoning.\n\n4. **Provide a Brief Explanation for the Rating:**\n\n   - Since the INITIAL RESPONSE introduces unfounded symptoms and diagnoses, it shows logical inconsistencies and fails to thoroughly process the INPUT. The reasoning provided does not coherently or accurately link to the input data.\n\n5. **Provide the Consistency Decision:**\n\n   - ```PREDICTION```No```"
