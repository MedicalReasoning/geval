Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 26\\nSex: M\\nIs your nose or the back of your throat itchy?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe itching in one or both eyes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live in in a big city?\\n    - N\\nAre you more likely to develop common allergies than the general population?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Allergic sinusitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Influenza'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe given information suggests a patient with no symptoms of common allergies, traveling less than 4 weeks, and living in a non-big city.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE shows an analysis of the input provided, aiming to deduce the most plausible diagnosis based on the symptoms and options given. However, there are notable inconsistencies and logical missteps in the reasoning:\n\n1. **Assessment of Symptoms**: The response states no symptoms of common allergies, but the final diagnosis of Bronchitis is made without proper explanation or connection to the provided evidence (which suggests no cough or symptoms typical of Bronchitis).\n\n2. **Logical Jumps**: It labels Influenza as \"the common cold\" inaccurately, since Influenza and the common cold are distinct conditions, although they have overlapping symptoms.\n\n3. **Diagnosis Attribution**: The diagnosis of Bronchitis is not logically substantiated given the evidence—no cough, no travel, and no smoking—all factors that could argue against Bronchitis.\n\n4. **Misinterpretation**: There's a misinterpretation of the term \"Influenza\" which is typically not equated to the common cold and carries different symptoms that have not been addressed with the presented symptoms effectively.\n\nThese missteps show gaps in logic, incorrect associations, and a final conclusion that is not backed by the evidence provided, leading to an inconsistent response. The correct label (Allergic sinusitis) was not addressed adequately in the analysis, revealing significant inconsistencies in reasoning.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
