Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 23\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain that improves when you lean forward?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the neck(R)\\n    - side of the neck(L)\\n    - palace\\n    - under the jaw\\n    - trachea\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have difficulty swallowing, or have a feeling of discomfort/blockage when swallowing?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high blood pressure or do you take medications to treat high blood pressure?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that you produce more saliva than usual?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your vaccinations up to date?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Epiglottitis\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Larygospasm\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Stable angina\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Chagas\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 23-year-old female with pain that improves when leaning forward, pain in the neck (right) and side of the neck, pain sensation, difficulty swallowing, no fever, no high blood pressure, no exposure to infectious risk factors, no respiratory symptoms, no recent travel, and no symptoms of diabetes, alcohol use, or vaccinations.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nEpiglottitis: No symptoms of respiratory infection.\n\nMyasthenia gravis: Not clear from the symptoms.\n\nPossible NSTEMI / STEMI: Cardiovascular symptoms don't fit.\n\nUnstable angina: Similar symptoms but not severe enough.\n\nHIV (initial infection): HIV symptoms don't fit.\n\nLarygospasm: Can cause pain but not severe.\n\nAcute pulmonary edema: Sudden onset.\n\nStable angina: Typical presentation, not severe.\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Not clear from symptoms.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome: No symptoms.\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Pain from a toxin.\n\nCardiac conditions: Not severe enough.\n\nSLE: Not clear from symptoms.\n\nPulmonary embolism: Chest pain.\n\nScombroid food poisoning: No flavor or smell.\n\nPSVT: Not clear from symptoms.\n\nChagas: No symptoms.\n\nPulmonary embolism: Chest pain.\n\nPSVT and Chagas are similar symptoms but not clear from the symptoms.\n\nLarygospasm and Acute dystonic reactions are not severe enough.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is Acute pulmonary edema.\n\n```Acute pulmonary edema```\n\nLABEL:\nEpiglottitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The initial response demonstrates significant inconsistencies and gaps in reasoning. Several symptoms listed in the INPUT are either misidentified or inaccurately assessed in the INITIAL RESPONSE. For instance, the INPUT clearly states that the patient does not feel pain that improves when leaning forward, but the INITIAL RESPONSE inaccurately states that it does. Additionally, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to thoroughly analyze the symptoms listed to reach a logical conclusion. The diagnosis given, \"Acute pulmonary edema,\" does not match the symptoms described in the INPUT nor does it align with the LABEL \"Epiglottitis.\" The logical flow is disjointed, with the response summarizing conditions ineffectively without adequately correlating them with the symptoms presented.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
