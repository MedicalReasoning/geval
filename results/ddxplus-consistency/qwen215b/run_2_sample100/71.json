Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 31\\nSex: F\\nHave you been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known heart defect?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating very irregularly or in a disorganized pattern?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America', 'options': '- Atrial fibrillation\\n- PSVT\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 31-year-old female who feels dizzy, lightheaded, and is not in the middle of any acute cardiac events, having never been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism or heart disease.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Occurs with rapid, irregular heartbeat.\n\nPSVT: Paramyocardial supraventricular tachycardia.\n\nAnemia: Low red blood cells.\n\nScombroid food poisoning: Common after eating raw or undercooked seafood.\n\nAn anemia would cause fatigue, not lightheadedness, but this does not match her symptoms.\n\nHypothyroidism is not a common cause of lightheadedness.\n\nHypertension is not a cause of lightheadedness.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is a normal clinical presentation with no other major concerns.\n\n```Normal clinical presentation```\n\nLABEL:\nAtrial fibrillation\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The initial response appears to lack consistency and contains several gaps in reasoning. Here's a breakdown of the issues:\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of Symptoms**: The input explicitly states the individual does not feel dizzy or lightheaded and does not experience symptoms associated with heart palpitations or irregular heartbeats. However, the initial response inaccurately presumes dizziness and lightheadedness.\n\n2. **Incorrect Exclusion of Conditions**: The response claims that anemia and hypothyroidism do not match the symptoms, but these conditions were not present according to the input; thus, their inclusion and subsequent dismissal appear irrelevant.\n\n3. **Inaccurate Analysis of Options**: The response notes several conditions and their symptoms, but fails to relate these accurately to the given evidence whereby none of the cardiac or palpitations-related symptoms are affirmed by the individual.\n\n4. **Confused Logical Conclusion**: The final conclusion suggests a \"normal clinical presentation,\" which contradicts the given label \"Atrial fibrillation.\" Moreover, this conclusion does not link logically to the analysis of the input.\n\n5. **Irrelevant Mention of Travel History**: Travel history is included in the input, but the response does not take this information into account in a meaningful way.\n\nDue to these inconsistencies and the failure to address the relevant aspects systematically, the reasoning is neither coherent nor logically consistent with the provided input.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
