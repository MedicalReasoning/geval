Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 39\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed any new fatigue, generalized and vague discomfort, diffuse (widespread) muscle aches or a change in your general well-being related to your consultation today?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pericarditis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Myocarditis\\n- GERD\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- PSVT\\n- Panic attack\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Chagas\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 39-year-old female with pain (a knife stroke) in the right breast (L), feeling it, not radiating, not precise, and not fast.

    "prediction": "Upon examining the INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE, the task was to evaluate the coherence and logical consistency of the arguments presented in the INITIAL RESPONSE.\n\nThe INITIAL RESPONSE begins by summarizing the patient's symptoms yet inaccurately notes the pain location as \"right breast (L)\" whereas it should be left breast according to the INPUT. Despite this minor inconsistency, the INITIAL RESPONSE goes through each diagnosis option listed in the INPUT systematically.\n\nWhile the INITIAL RESPONSE could be clearer, and perhaps provides overly brief reasoning for dismissing some options, it does indeed address all of the options provided. The reasoning for excluding each diagnosis is rooted in the symptoms or characteristics typically seen with each condition versus what is present in the INPUT. The response concludes that a Panic attack is the most probable diagnosis based on symptoms such as \"felt, not radiating,\" despite lacking strong evidence for this conclusion from the symptom list outlined.\n\nIn terms of logical flow, the suggestions provided for each possible condition is consistent, albeit the link between symptom analysis and condition could be more explicit and the final choice of a Panic attack is arguable, yet systematically deduced from the original options provided without inconsistency.\n\nThere are some minor logical leaps and a mistake in noting \"right breast\" instead of left, but overall the response stays consistent and thoroughly considers each option, maintaining a logical sequence of reasoning.\n\nPREDICTION: ```Yes```"
