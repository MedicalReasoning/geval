Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 54\\nSex: M\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - occiput\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 54-year-old male with no recent contact with infected persons, living alone, no pain related to his reason for consulting, no pain in top of head, cheek(R), cheek(L), or occiput. The pain is described as sensitive and causing discomfort, intensity 4/10, does not radiate, located 2/10, and appears slowly. He doesn't smoke, has no sore throat, no diffuse muscle pain, runs a clear runny nose, and hasn't traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- URTI: Could be a cold, but typically presents with symptoms of fever and cough.\n\n- Cluster headache: Usually presents with a \"wingspan\" pattern of pain and has a history of migraines.\n\n- Chagas: Common in Central and South America, can present with abdominal pain and vomiting.\n\n- Anemia: Common in elderly men, but not typically with these symptoms.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is URTI.\n\n```URTI```\n\nLABEL:\nURTI\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several errors and inconsistencies:\n\n1. The response incorrectly states there is no pain in areas such as \"top of head, cheek(R), cheek(L), or occiput,\" while the INPUT specifies pain in these areas.\n2. The reasoning about the symptoms of URTI is incomplete; the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to mention that URTI doesn't typically present with localized head pain, which is a prominent symptom in this case.\n3. The reasoning for ruling out other options (Cluster headache, Chagas, Anemia) is vague and lacks substantial evidence from the given symptoms.\n4. It mentions a \"clear runny nose\" which conflicts with the INPUT that states \"no nasal congestion or a clear runny nose.\"\n5. The logical flow and progression of the thought process are flawed due to these discrepancies and gaps in dealing with the presented symptoms and available options.\n\nOverall, the analysis in the INITIAL RESPONSE doesn't demonstrate a deep, methodical approach to evaluating the symptoms against the potential diagnoses, leading to inconsistencies and unsupported conclusions.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
