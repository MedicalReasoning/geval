Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 49\\nSex: M\\nHave you started or taken any antipsychotic medication within the last 7 days?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever felt like you were suffocating for a very short time associated with inability to breathe or speak?\\n    - N\\nHave you been treated in hospital recently for nausea, agitation, intoxication or aggressive behavior and received medication via an intravenous or intramuscular route?\\n    - N\\nDo you have trouble keeping your tongue in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hard time opening/raising one or both eyelids?\\n    - N\\nDo you have annoying muscle spasms in your face, neck or any other part of your body?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 49-year-old male without any symptoms or treatment history, indicating either no exposure to antipsychotic medications or a different diagnosis, consistent with a diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis.\n\n```Myasthenia gravis```\n\nLABEL:\nAcute dystonic reactions\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INPUT provides a series of questions related to symptoms and medical history, all of which the subject has responded \"No\" to. The options to diagnose based on this information are \"Acute dystonic reactions\" and \"Myasthenia gravis.\" The key symptom for Myasthenia gravis, indicated by the options, would typically include muscle weakness, difficulty in breathing, or speaking, which the subject does not report (\"N\" for \"No\" to all related questions).\n\nThe INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly matches the symptoms (or lack thereof) with \"Myasthenia gravis.\" Myasthenia gravis usually presents symptoms such as muscle fatigue and weakness, which aren't indicated in the evidences. The subject does not exhibit symptoms typically associated with either diagnosis but more importantly does not have any symptoms of muscle weakness that would align with Myasthenia gravis. \n\nAcute dystonic reactions usually occur when there is recent antipsychotic medication use, which is also not the case here. However, the determination of the INITIAL RESPONSE seems to be based on irrelevant factors without justified reasoning, leading to an unsupported conclusion.\n\nThe INITIAL RESPONSE fails to provide logical reasoning, as it doesn't clearly address why it rules out Acute dystonic reactions based on the given symptoms or lack thereof. It makes an unsupported assumption by matching the subject's lack of symptoms with Myasthenia gravis without proper justification.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
