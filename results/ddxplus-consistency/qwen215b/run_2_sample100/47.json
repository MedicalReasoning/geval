Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 26\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Influenza\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Chagas\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 26-year-old female with no history of fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose, or cough.

    "prediction": "To evaluate the consistency of the INITIAL RESPONSE, we need to consider the following points:\n\n1. The INITIAL RESPONSE begins by inaccurately stating that the patient \"attended a daycare,\" while the INPUT explicitly mentioned that the patient responded \"N\" to attending or working in a daycare. This is a contradiction.\n\n2. The response lists several conditions to consider: URTI, Influenza, HIV (initial infection), Bronchitis, Tuberculosis, Pneumonia, Chronic rhinosinusitis, Chagas, and Acute rhinosinusitis. However, the reasoning for excluding or considering each diagnosis lacks logical depth and does not directly correlate to the symptoms presented.\n\n3. The INITIAL RESPONSE finishes by suggesting URTI or Acute rhinosinusitis as the diagnosis without a clear justification tracing back to which specific symptoms match those conditions more so than the others. It disregards evaluating reasons for excluding other conditions (such as chronic rhinosinusitis, bronchitis, etc.) or stating why those can be ruled out.\n\n4. The recommendation lacks detailed reasoning, making it hard to follow the significance of the absence of symptoms like fever, sore throat, and nasal issues in leading to the URTI or Acute rhinosinusitis diagnosis over other listed options.\n\nGiven these points, the INITIAL RESPONSE contains contradictions and lacks detailed consistency in reasoning, which undermines its overall coherence.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
