Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 47\\nSex: F\\nDo you regularly take stimulant drugs?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever felt like you were suffocating for a very short time associated with inability to breathe or speak?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hard time opening/raising one or both eyelids?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you suddenly have difficulty or an inability to open your mouth or have jaw pain when opening it?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute dystonic reactions'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 47-year-old female who is not regularly taking stimulant drugs and has a history of fainting but no hard eyelid problems, no travel, and no sudden mouth opening difficulties.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Rare.

    "prediction": "The initial response reads and interprets the INPUT: a 47-year-old female with negative responses to several potential symptoms and risk factors associated with acute dystonic reactions. \n\nHowever, the INITIAL RESPONSE includes an assumption about a \"history of fainting,\" which is not included in the given INPUT information. Additionally, while the response assesses the possibility of acute dystonic reactions, it does not elaborate on why this condition is the \"most probable diagnosis\" nor does it provide a comprehensive comparison against the absence of symptoms that typically suggest such a diagnosis.\n\nMoreover, the response lacks a detailed exploration of the provided evidence such as specifics related to \"acute dystonic reactions.\" Ideally, a logical step-by-step assessment should be included to better connect the evidence to the conclusion. Due to these shortcomings and logical leaps, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks full coherence and completeness in its reasoning.\n\nThus, the response is inconsistent based on the criterion provided.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
