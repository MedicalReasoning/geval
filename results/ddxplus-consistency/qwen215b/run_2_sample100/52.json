Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 27\\nSex: F\\nAre you infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - sickening\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - biceps(R)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - thoracic spine\\n    - shoulder(R)\\n    - shoulder(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high cholesterol or do you take medications to treat high cholesterol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high blood pressure or do you take medications to treat high blood pressure?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a problem with poor circulation?\\n    - N\\nAre you feeling nauseous or do you feel like vomiting?\\n    - N\\nAre you a former smoker?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have close family members who had a cardiovascular disease problem before the age of 50?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- GERD\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- Chagas\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Panic attack\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 27-year-old female who is not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus and reports no pain or shortness of breath.

    "prediction": "To evaluate the INITIAL RESPONSE's consistency, let's break down the evidence provided in the input and examine how the response addresses it:\n\n1. **The patient’s symptoms and history**:\n   - The patient reports severe, precisely located pain in the lower chest, sides of the chest, and breast areas, with radiation to the shoulders, biceps, and thyroid cartilage, but no shortness of breath or nausea.\n   - The patient has no risk factors like smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or family history of cardiovascular disease.\n\n2. **Initial Response Analysis**:\n   - The response initially listed misleading information that the patient reports no pain, which contradicts the input that indicates severe pain (intensity 10) in multiple locations.\n   - It then proceeds to analyze each diagnosis option, but it incorrectly disregards critical information about the patient’s symptoms and age group relevance based on erroneous assumptions.\n   - Each condition analysis lacks sufficient relevance to the specific presented symptoms and age group of the patient, making sweeping generalizations without diving into the evidence specifics (e.g., describing conditions as \"rare in this age group\" without fact-checking).\n\n3. **Possible Diagnosis Evaluation**:\n   - The input diagnosis label is \"Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\", a type of heart attack that should warrant serious consideration given the severe chest pain and pain radiation described.\n   - The response overlooked important data points and inaccurately concluded Sarcoidosis based on incorrect age group generalization, ignoring critical symptoms of acute chest pain with radiation, aligning more with NSTEMI/STEMI possibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, the initial response failed to consistently align with the given evidence, showing significant logical gaps, inaccurate reasoning, and contradictions. This indicates inadequacy in meeting the criterion of thoroughness and comprehensiveness.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
