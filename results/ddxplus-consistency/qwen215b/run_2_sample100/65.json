Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 10\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - tugging\\n    - burning\\n    - sickening\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - hypochondrium(L)\\n    - belly\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - lower chest\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hiatal hernia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you think you are pregnant or are you currently pregnant?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently thrown up blood or something resembling coffee beans?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that get worse after eating?\\n    - N', 'options': '- GERD'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 10-year-old female with a sensitive, a knife stroke, and a burning sensation that starts in the stomach and goes up into the throat.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inaccuracies and inconsistencies. It incorrectly states that the patient experiences \"a burning sensation that starts in the stomach and goes up into the throat,\" which contradicts the evidence given in the INPUT, where it is clearly mentioned that the patient does not have such a burning sensation. The logic flow is disrupted by this incorrect statement, leading to an inconsistent conclusion. Additionally, the analysis of GERD is not thorough and presents contradictions, as it states GERD symptoms both fit and do not fit, without clear reasoning. Furthermore, the mention of asthma and hiatal hernia is irrelevant, as these were not options provided. The conclusion of GERD being the likely diagnosis is not supported by a coherent argument, given the patient's symptoms and provided evidence.\n\nTherefore, due to the inaccuracies and logical inconsistencies, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not meet the criterion for Consistency.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
