Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 20\\nSex: M\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - back of the neck\\n    - side of the neck(L)\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - occiput\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you feel so tired that you are unable to do your usual activities or are you stuck in your bed all day long?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - NA\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - N\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - N\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you immunosuppressed?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Influenza\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Chagas\\n- URTI'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 20-year-old male with a high fever (measured or felt) and an itchy rash.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inconsistencies and logical flaws. Firstly, it incorrectly states that the patient has a \"high fever (measured or felt) and an itchy rash,\" while the INPUT specifies that the patient has no fever and no rash with an intensity of pain of 0, which implies no itching either. Secondly, the diagnostic reasoning does not match the symptoms presented. The symptoms provided in the INPUT primarily revolve around intense neck and head pain with no systemic symptoms like fever, rash, or respiratory issues. Despite this, the INITIAL RESPONSE concludes the most probable diagnosis is an URTI, which generally presents with respiratory symptoms, not reflected in the provided evidence. Moreover, the RESPONSE incorrectly eliminates or characterizes potential diagnoses without considering the patient's symptoms thoroughly. Hence, the reasoning is inconsistent and contains significant gaps, leading to an inaccurate conclusion.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
