Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 70\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - occiput\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Influenza\\n- Bronchitis\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 70-year-old female with no fever, no sore throat, no diffuse muscle pain, no nasal congestion, no cough, no travel, and having a pain that feels \"sensitive\" and radiates to the top of the head.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provided contains several logical inconsistencies and leaps in reasoning. Here's an analysis:\n\n1. The response initially lists symptoms such as pain being 'sensitive', located on the top of the head, and a lack of fever, sore throat, and nasal congestion. However, it erroneously mentions a rash on her cheeks, which is not present in the given input.\n\n2. The logical deduction from the symptom set to possible diagnoses seems flawed. For example, URTI (Upper Respiratory Tract Infection) was labeled as most likely, yet the response concludes Chronic rhinosinusitis without explicitly ruling out URTI based on the given symptoms.\n\n3. Additionally, the response makes unsupported claims such as Influenza being common in the summer, which is not a valid medical assertion; influenza is generally more common in colder months.\n\n4. The conclusion for Chronic rhinosinusitis lacks a clear link from the evidence provided. The INPUT does not mention longstanding symptoms typically associated with chronic conditions.\n\n5. The reasoning does not sufficiently address the differential diagnosis process, and many assumptions appear to be incorrect or irrelevant based on the input data.\n\nThe aforementioned issues highlight a lack of a coherent and methodical approach to analyzing the problem presented in the INPUT, leading to a conclusion that is not adequately supported by the evidence. \n\nAs such, the response fails to meet the criterion for coherence and logical consistency.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
