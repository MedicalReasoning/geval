Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 51\\nSex: M\\nDo you have an active cancer?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - a knife stroke\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - scapula(R)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nHave you been unable to move or get up for more than 3 consecutive days within the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have swelling in one or more areas of your body?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - posterior aspect of the ankle(L)\\n    - calf(L)\\nHave you had surgery within the last month?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Ebola\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- GERD\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 51-year-old male without any signs of active cancer, coughing up blood, and pain in the right lower chest.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not consistently address the INPUT provided. The response incorrectly states that the patient's pain is in the \"right lower chest,\" while the INPUT specifies multiple locations, including the lower chest, sides of the chest (R and L), scapula (L), and posterior chest wall (L). The response also incorrectly concludes that there is no radiating pain, despite the INPUT indicating radiation to both sides of the chest and scapula.\n\nAdditionally, the INITIAL RESPONSE lists and analyzes various diagnosis options, mostly dismissing them as \"not typical for this age\" without a clear basis for this conclusion. The response does not consistently or logically connect the symptoms to the dismissal of these diagnoses. The reasoning lacks thoroughness and makes unsupported assumptions, leading to an incorrect conclusion that myocarditis is the most probable diagnosis, which contradicts the LABEL of pulmonary embolism.\n\nTherefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE is inconsistent in its analysis and has logical gaps, failing to methodically assess the options based on the evidence provided.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
