Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 35\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - side of the neck(R)\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - trachea\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high blood pressure or do you take medications to treat high blood pressure?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that the tone of your voice has become deeper, softer or hoarse?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Epiglottitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Larygospasm\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Unstable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 35-year-old female with throat pain (knife-like, sharp), pain localized to the tonsils, difficulty breathing, and no shortness of breath.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE evaluates the symptoms and compares them against a range of possible diagnoses, ultimately concluding with a recommendation of pulmonary embolism. However, the assessment is flawed for the following reasons:\n\n1. The patient does not exhibit shortness of breath, a key symptom typically associated with pulmonary embolism, yet the INITIAL RESPONSE suggests this as the final diagnosis. This represents a logical inconsistency, as the lack of shortness of breath is acknowledged but then seems ignored in determining the final recommendation.\n\n2. The INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly dismisses epiglottitis, the correct label, without thorough consideration. Epiglottitis can indeed present with sharp throat pain, as seen in this case. The response states that epiglottitis is common in children but fails to consider that it can also affect adults.\n\n3. The response largely dismisses other potential diagnoses without providing substantial reasoning, merely labeling them as \"rare\" or \"not typically associated with throat pain\" without deeper analysis of how these conditions could relate to the symptoms presented.\n\n4. There is some confusion regarding symptoms as the INITIAL RESPONSE mentions \"difficulty breathing,\" although the INPUT specifies no significant difficulty in breathing, which adds inconsistency to the assessment.\n\nGiven these issues, the reasoning lacks coherence and completeness, leading to a flawed diagnostic conclusion.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
