Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 57\\nSex: F\\nHave you been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known heart defect?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating very irregularly or in a disorganized pattern?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that are increased with physical exertion but alleviated with rest?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Atrial fibrillation\\n- PSVT\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Panic attack\\n- Anemia\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 57-year-old female without known heart valve issues, COPD, or previous heart issues, who experienced shortness of breath and slight dizziness.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several issues which indicate that it is not consistent and well-reasoned.\n\n1. Initial Misinterpretation: The response incorrectly reinterprets the patient's symptoms. It suggests the patient experienced shortness of breath and slight dizziness, although in the evidence provided, both were denied (the patient indicated \"N\" for these symptoms).\n\n2. Misrepresentation of Symptoms: The analysis of atrial fibrillation is inaccurately stated. Atrial fibrillation can indeed be associated with shortness of breath and irregular heartbeats, thus the reasoning for dismissal does not hold.\n\n3. PSVT Misdefinition: The response mistakenly expands PSVT as \"Pectus Sternal Vibra Triae\" which is incorrect. PSVT stands for Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia, which is a condition characterized by episodes of rapid heart rate.\n\n4. Informational Gaps: There were generic descriptors given for several conditions which provide no substantial reasoning grounded in the context of the case. Terms like \"unusual\" for panic attack or \"anemia symptoms\" for anemia lack depth necessary for logical evaluation.\n\n5. Logical Leap: The conclusion arrives at \"panic attack\" as a diagnosis without substantiating this through the evidence, considering the patient denied experiencing anxiety or characteristics typical of panic attacks.\n\nGiven these issues, the response lacks coherence in logical progression and skips substantial evaluative steps necessary for sound reasoning.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
