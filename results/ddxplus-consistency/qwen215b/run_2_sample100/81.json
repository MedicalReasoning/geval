Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 73\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 73-year-old female with burning pain in the throat, tonsil, thyroid cartilage, and pharynx, located under the jaw, not radiating, and intense at 5.

It's much more consistent with viral pharyngitis.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE assessment of the situation exhibits an inconsistency in its details and reasoning process. The evidence states that the pain intensity is 3, but the response incorrectly lists it as 5, which is a key detail in evaluating the condition. The summary analysis of the conditions also contains inconsistent logic. Viral pharyngitis is noted as having throat pain that is \"not typical,\" yet the conclusion presumes viral pharyngitis because \"intense, localized pain is likely to be a symptom of a viral infection,\" which contradicts the previous statement and fails to properly align with the input nuances. The omitted mention of no cough contradicts the conclusion if potentially considering viral infections. Overall, the reasoning does not adequately account for the provided evidence nor carry out a thorough logical assessment of all conditions, revealing gaps and inconsistencies.\n\nPREDICTION```No```"
