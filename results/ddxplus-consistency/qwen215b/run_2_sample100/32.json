Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 51\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - sensitive\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - tugging\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\n    - belly\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you think you are pregnant or are you currently pregnant?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that get worse after eating?\\n    - N', 'options': '- GERD\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nPatient is 51 years old with a burning sensation associated with a bitter taste in the mouth, no cough, no traveling in the last 4 weeks.

    "prediction": "INITIAL RESPONSE indicates several inconsistencies and contradictions when evaluated against the INPUT. The findings identified below highlight the issues:\n\n1. Misinterpretation of Symptoms: The INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly states that the patient is experiencing a burning sensation associated with a bitter taste in the mouth, whereas the INPUT clearly specifies that there is no such burning sensation and bitter taste.\n\n2. Inaccurate Assessment: Despite the patient's symptoms of chest and abdominal pain, described with specific characteristics like burning, haunting, a knife stroke, tugging, and being rated at intensity 6/10, the response improperly matched these symptoms to a \"Spontaneous rib fracture,\" which typically doesn't relate to burning sensations. Furthermore, \"Spontaneous rib fracture\" was cited as the most likely diagnosis, yet the correct label was GERD. This conflict further undermines the consistency of logic given the provided symptom descriptions.\n\n3. Incorrect Logical Steps: Thereâ€™s an additional factual error when the response claims that burning sensation is not related to GERD. GERD commonly involves burning chest pain (heartburn) which fits the report of burning sensation in the INPUT.\n\nOverall, the reasoning in the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and overlooks critical aspects of the INPUT description, leading to improper conclusions about the diagnosis possibilities. Hence, it contains significant gaps and logical missteps.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
