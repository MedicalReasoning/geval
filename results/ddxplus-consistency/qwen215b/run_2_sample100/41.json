Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 26\\nSex: M\\nIs your nose or the back of your throat itchy?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe itching in one or both eyes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live in in a big city?\\n    - N\\nAre you more likely to develop common allergies than the general population?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Allergic sinusitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Influenza'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe given information suggests a patient with no symptoms of common allergies, traveling less than 4 weeks, and living in a non-big city.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE states that the most likely diagnosis is \"Bronchitis\" despite the patient showing no symptoms typically associated with Bronchitis such as a cough. The reasoning provided does not align with the patient's lack of symptoms for allergy, congestion, and having not been to a large city or out of the country, which were factors considered wrongly to discount \"Allergic sinusitis\" which is actually the correct label. Furthermore, the explanation suggests a misunderstanding of Influenza as \"the common cold,\" ignoring possible overlapping symptoms with other conditions.\n\nThe analysis fails to conclusively address why the provided evidence points to Bronchitis, especially given the contradiction in referencing symptoms associated with “URTI” (Upper Respiratory Tract Infection) – which can indeed also fit Bronchitis – without any presented symptoms. The decision appears to rely on unsubstantiated assumptions rather than evidence, leading to a lack of logical consistency.\n\nThus, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and includes significant gaps in reasoning.\n \n```PREDICTION```No```"
