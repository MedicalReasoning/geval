Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 56\\nSex: F\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Larygospasm'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 56-year-old woman who has a high-pitched sound when breathing in and has not traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE makes several missteps that lead to inconsistent reasoning:\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of Provided Evidence**: The patient explicitly does not have a high-pitched sound when breathing in, as mentioned in the evidence. However, the analysis improperly assumes the presence of such a sound and evaluates conditions that involve it, which strays from the provided evidence.\n\n2. **Contradictory Conclusion**: Despite the evidence indicating \"no high-pitched sound when breathing in,\" the response concludes with \"Larygospasm,\" which typically involves a noisy or high-pitched breathing sound, further contradicting the evidence provided.\n\n3. **Irrelevance and Errors in Option Analysis**: The response lists and evaluates medical conditions that are irrelevant or unjustified given the provided evidence, indicating a significant leap of logic. The evaluation of these conditions does not align with the initial symptom absence as documented.\n\nGiven these inconsistencies, the response fails to logically and coherently evaluate the given input. Thus, the response lacks a clear and structured thought process, with contradictions undermining its reasoning flow.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
