Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 34\\nSex: M\\nHave you recently had a viral infection?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a pericarditis?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - thoracic spine\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pericarditis\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- PSVT\\n- GERD\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Panic attack\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 34-year-old male with a rapidly developing severe shoulder pain, characterized as a knife stroke in the upper chest.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits several inconsistencies and logical gaps. Firstly, the summary mentions \"severe shoulder pain,\" yet the pain intensity is rated as 4 (on a scale of 0-10) in the evidences, which does not necessarily indicate severe pain. Additionally, the response inaccurately claims the pain is felt when lying down, while the INPUT shows that symptoms are not worse when lying down. There is also a misinterpretation of evidence related to pain radiating to the posterior chest wall—the patient does not report shoulder pain. The response misaligns conditions with the symptoms: it states less likely candidates when they align with the severity and nature of the described pain phenomena. The reasoning lacks thorough analysis leading to a diagnosis, as the selected diagnosis of \"Acute dystonic reactions\" lacks grounding in the provided evidence or typical presentations of such reactions. Ultimately, the diagnosis omits the LABEL of Pericarditis without satisfactory assessment, indicating a gap in the consistency of the response's reasoning.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
