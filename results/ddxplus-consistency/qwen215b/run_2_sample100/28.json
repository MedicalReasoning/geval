Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 10\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you immunosuppressed?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Influenza\\n- Pneumonia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 10-year-old girl with sore throat, cough, tonsil pain, and no fever.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE begins with a step-by-step analysis, making it seem methodical. However, there are inconsistencies between the INPUT and the analysis as presented:\n\n1. The INPUT mentions \"tonsil(R), tonsil(L), thyroid cartilage, palace, pharynx\" as pain locations, but the response only mentions \"tonsil pain\" and misses other critical locations like the thyroid cartilage and pharynx.\n\n2. The INPUT clearly states \"Do you have a fever? N\", while the response says “no fever”. This matches, however, the response then incorrectly implies in the influenza analysis that the absence of fever is significant, making it sound contradictory.\n\n3. The response misunderstands some symptom relations, such as associating sore throat and cough with bronchitis, when bronchitis generally involves a productive cough.\n\n4. The patient does not have a cough per INPUT but the response repeatedly considers cough symptoms when analyzing the options.\n\n5. Ultimately, the final conclusion drawn (Viral pharyngitis) is aligned with the evidence provided, although some logical consistency is missing in reaching this from the reasoning provided.\n\nDue to these gaps and contradictions, especially around the symptoms considered and their matches with the conditions discussed, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks a coherent and entirely logical progression.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
