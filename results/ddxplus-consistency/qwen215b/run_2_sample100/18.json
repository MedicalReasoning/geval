Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 48\\nSex: F\\nDo you have Rheumatoid Arthritis?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis (UC)?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had pneumonia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you immunosuppressed?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 48-year-old female presenting with symptoms of coughing up blood (negative for pneumonia, COPD, or other lung diseases), shortness of breath (negative for bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and bronchospasm/cough exacerbation), and anemia (negative for myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders).\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nBronchitis: May present with blood in sputum but usually due to inflammation.\n\nBronchiectasis: Involves atelectasis and hypoxemia.\n\nPneumonia: May cause cough and shortness of breath.\n\nPulmonary neoplasm: Can be diagnosed through imaging.\n\nAcute COPD exacerbation/infection: May present with shortness of breath.\n\nTuberculosis: Common in the upper respiratory tract.\n\nPulmonary embolism: Usually caused by a blood clot.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome: Rare.\n\nBronchospasm/acute asthma exacerbation: May be seen in asthmatics.\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Heart rhythm disorder.\n\nMyocarditis: Cardiac inflammation.\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Neurological.\n\nMyasthenia gravis: Muscle weakness.\n\nAnemia: Red blood cell problems.\n\nPSVT: Potential indication of a cardiac issue.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is **Tuberculosis**.\n\n```Tuberculosis```\n\nLABEL:\nBronchiectasis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE has several inconsistencies. The response begins by incorrectly stating that the patient is presenting with 'coughing up blood,' 'shortness of breath,' and 'anemia,' even though the input states 'No' to coughing up blood, shortness of breath, and mentions nothing about anemia. This indicates a significant gap in logic and coherence, as the response misrepresents the input evidence.\n\nFurthermore, the analysis provided for each option is very general and not linked to the patient's specific situation, which would be a lack of methodical reasoning. Finally, the initial response concludes with a diagnosis of 'Tuberculosis,' which doesn't logically align or address the label's given conclusion of 'Bronchiectasis' and lacks sufficient justification related to the specific conditions or symptoms related to the patient.\n\nThe reasoning is not systematic or thorough with contradictions and unfounded assumptions, such as diagnosing based on symptoms or conditions the patient explicitly denies having according to the input evidence. Therefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE is not consistent with the provided criterion.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
