Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 2\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - pharynx\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Influenza\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Allergic sinusitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- URTI\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Croup\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 2-year-old male with a burning pain on the side of the chest.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE involves assessing different conditions available in the 'options' against the symptoms and details given in 'evidences'. However, the INITIAL RESPONSE presents significant inconsistencies.\n\n1. The evaluation for 'Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation' claims it is not typically seen in children, which is incorrect. Asthma symptoms, including bronchospasms, are often common in children.\n\n2. Regarding 'Influenza', the response claims it's common in adults but doesn't consider its prevalence in children.\n\n3. The analysis skips over important points about 'Bronchitis', which appears in the LABEL: Bronchitis. The response misses the potential link between a burning pain in the chest and conditions like bronchitis which can cause discomfort even without a cough being present initially.\n\n4. 'Pneumonia' and 'Bronchitis' are not accurately analyzed. While pneumonia would likely have coughs and fevers, a detailed assessment of why 'Bronchitis' could be deemed 'likely' isn't provided.\n\n5. Additionally, the choice of 'Viral pharyngitis' is not well justified as related symptoms such as coughing or nasal drip are absent. The burning chest pain is also inconsistent with a viral pharyngitis, which typically involves throat pain.\n\nOverall, while the response attempts to step through the options systematically, gaps in the logical analysis and incorrect premises lead to an inconsistent final choice. Therefore, the review lacks coherence in reasoning and fails to accurately evaluate against the provided evidence and label.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
