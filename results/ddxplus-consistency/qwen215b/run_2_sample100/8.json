Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 3\\nSex: F\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you take corticosteroids?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - tugging\\n    - heavy\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - ankle(R)\\n    - ankle(L)\\n    - thigh(R)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(R)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHave you gained weight recently?\\n    - N\\nDo you have heart failure?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have liver cirrhosis?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had surgery to remove lymph nodes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have swelling in one or more areas of your body?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - ankle(L)\\n    - thigh(R)\\n    - thigh(L)\\n    - sole(R)\\n    - sole(L)\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known kidney problem resulting in an inability to retain proteins?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Localized edema\\n- Chagas\\n- Anaphylaxis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 3-year-old female with no history, no corticosteroid use, no pain related to her condition, no swelling, and no surgery.

    "prediction": "1. Examine the INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully to understand the provided information and the reasoning given.\n  \n2. Assess the accuracy and consistency of the INITIAL RESPONSE with the information presented in the INPUT and the subsequent reasoning applied.\n\n3. The INPUT provides comprehensive evidence about a 3-year-old female who presents with pain, though pain is not related to the reason for consulting, and varying levels of precision, intensity, and speed, but there is no note of swelling in some areas listed like ankle(L) and other parts, as though there is no history of heart valve issues, corticosteroid use, known kidney problems, travel, etc. \n\n4. Evaluate the INITIAL RESPONSE based on this evidence:\n   - It first provides a coherent, logical assessment or summary of the INPUT.\n   - There is a gap in logic since the response contradicts the provided evidence from the Input: It states \"no swelling\" which is incorrect because swelling was mentioned in several areas.\n   - The response rules out \"Localized edema\" by categorizing some options as not likely without thorough explanation, merely based on general assumptions instead of analyzing possible causes of the condition in a structured way.\n   \n5. It also does not provide expansive reasoning for why one condition would fit over another based on the given symptoms and evidence, such as the pain and its characteristics.\n\n6. In considering the thoroughness and logical progression, the assessment lacks depth in explaining why localized edema was marked as the most likely condition with the associated symptoms. The assumptions made hang loosely instead of being fortified by details from the evidence.\n\n7. Conclude that the INITIAL RESPONSE has instances of oversimplification in lieu of comprehensive analysis and has inconsistencies regarding swelling evidence initially provided.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
