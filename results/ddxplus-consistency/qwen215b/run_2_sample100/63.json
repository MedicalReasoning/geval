Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 4\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - sensitive\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - burning\\n    - scary\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - hypochondrium(R)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hiatal hernia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that get worse after eating?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N', 'options': '- GERD\\n- Anaphylaxis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 4-year-old male with a sensation of a knife stroke and burning sensation, most intense in the upper chest, radiating to the throat, with no elevation of blood pressure, no temperature, no dark urine.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE shows some inconsistencies and gaps in its reasoning. It suggests a diagnosis of GERD for the 4-year-old child, but there are several issues with this conclusion:\n\n1. The evidence provided in the INPUT indicates that the child does not feel pain related to the reason for consulting and does not have symptoms such as a burning sensation starting in the stomach and going up to the throat, nor are the symptoms worsening after eating or when lying down. These are typical indicators of GERD, yet the INITIAL RESPONSE does not address these discrepancies.\n\n2. The response mentions \"no elevation of blood pressure, no temperature, no dark urine,\" but these factors were not mentioned in the INPUT, which suggests an inconsistency in reasoning.\n\n3. The reasoning relies on the limited information from the options and disregards relevant details from the INPUT that contradict the conclusion of GERD, such as the absence of classical GERD symptoms.\n\nIn summary, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and has significant gaps in reasoning, leading to a conclusion that does not fully align with the INPUT provided.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
