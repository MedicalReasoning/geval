Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 67\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - upper chest\\n    - pharynx\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your vaccinations up to date?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- URTI\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- GERD\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Panic attack\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Stable angina\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 67-year-old female with a sore throat, cough, and shortness of breath.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE lacks consistency due to several factors:\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of Input Information**: The response mentions the patient has a sore throat, cough, and shortness of breath, but the input clearly states that the patient does not have these symptoms. This is a significant inconsistency as it forms the basis for further diagnosis.\n\n2. **Contradictory Reasoning**: The reasoning around diagnoses such as COPD and GERD are presented without considering the patient's actual symptoms or lack thereof in the input. For instance, assessing these conditions as \"not typical\" or \"unlikely\" lacks a coherent rationale based on the input.\n\n3. **Ignored Symptoms and Overall Assessment**: The patient reports multiple pain locations with certain characteristics but these are largely ignored in the reasoning provided. The analysis skips over these details which could significantly impact the potential diagnosis.\n\n4. **Final Diagnosis Conclusion**: Concluding with a diagnosis of URTI does not logically flow from the analysis as it does not align with the input given symptoms.\n\nOverall, the response fails to present a consistent and logical progression by not accurately reflecting the details from the input and making unsupported assessments based on those inaccuracies.\n\nTherefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not meet the criterion of consistency. \n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
