Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 16\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain that improves when you lean forward?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - side of the neck(R)\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you regularly take stimulant drugs?\\n    - N\\nDo you have difficulty swallowing, or have a feeling of discomfort/blockage when swallowing?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that you produce more saliva than usual?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America\\nHave you noticed that the tone of your voice has become deeper, softer or hoarse?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Epiglottitis\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Larygospasm\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Chagas\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Viral pharyngitis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nAn 16-year-old male with pain that improves with leaning forward, related to his reason for consulting, and pain in the tonsil, side of the neck, pharynx, under the jaw, and tonsil.

    "prediction": "1. The INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly states that the patient experiences pain that improves with leaning forward. The INPUT clearly states \"Do you have pain that improves when you lean forward? - N\", indicating that the pain does not improve in this way. This misinterpretation leads to several inaccuracies in the differential diagnosis.\n\n2. The INITIAL RESPONSE lists symptoms and conditions that contradict the INPUT. For instance, the response mentions that the patient is \"comfortable swallowing, experiences shortness of breath, has diabetes, rarely produces saliva, breathes through a high-pitched sound, has not traveled outside the U.S., and has a hoarse tone of voice,\" but the INPUT directly contradicts these symptoms. \n\n3. Many of the differentials listed do not logically follow from the INITIAL RESPONSE symptoms. For example, viral pharyngitis, which is suggested as the most probable diagnosis, is associated with symptoms such as fever and difficulty swallowing, which the patient specifically does not have (as per the INPUT).\n\n4. The response leads to an inaccurate conclusion, inconsistent with the details provided in the INPUT, which is focused on the symptoms, particularly characterized pain and the absence of other symptoms like fever or swelling that correspond with the correct label (Epiglottitis).\n\nThese points collectively indicate a lack of coherence and inconsistencies within the INITIAL RESPONSE.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
