Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 73\\nSex: F\\nDo you have a poor diet?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a diagnosis of anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any family members who have been diagnosed with anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tugging\\n    - exhausting\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - temple(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel so tired that you are unable to do your usual activities or are you stuck in your bed all day long?\\n    - N\\nDo you constantly feel fatigued or do you have non-restful sleep?\\n    - N\\nDo you have chronic kidney failure?\\n    - N\\nAre you taking any new oral anticoagulants ((NOACs)?\\n    - N\\nIs your skin much paler than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you think you are pregnant or are you currently pregnant?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North Africa\\nIs your BMI less than 18.5, or are you underweight?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Anemia\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Chagas\\n- Cluster headache\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- SLE\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 73-year-old female with a history of anemia and pain mostly in the temple region, characterized as \"tugging\" and \"exhausting\", with no radiating pain.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inconsistencies and reasoning shortcuts:\n\n1. **Incorrect Assumptions**: The initial response assumes a history of anemia for the patient, which contradicts the evidence provided in the INPUT where it clearly states \"Have you ever had a diagnosis of anemia? - N.\" This is a significant error.\n\n2. **Chronic vs Acute Pain**: The response focuses on excluding conditions based on the pain being chronic. However, the INPUT describes pain intensity as '1' out of 10, implying mild pain and does not label it as chronic. The response incorrectly interprets the pain as chronic without evidence from the INPUT.\n\n3. **Logical Flow**: The reasoning does not follow a clear path. It dismisses options not based on given symptoms but rather on unsupported assumptions about the chronic nature of the pain.\n\n4. **Contradictory Statements**: The response lists anemia as \"Present in older adults, but not too severe for pain,\" yet concludes it as the most likely diagnosis, contradicting its own reasoning.\n\nAs the reasoning steps show significant gaps, contradictions, and a misinterpretation of facts, the response lacks coherence and a logical progression of thought needed to support the diagnosis of anemia.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
