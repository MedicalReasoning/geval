Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 41\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a cramp\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\n    - hypochondrium(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are (or were) choking or suffocating?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with depression?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from chronic anxiety?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel lightheaded and dizzy or do you feel like you are about to faint?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a migraine or is a member of your family known to have migraines?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are dying or were you afraid that you were about do die?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had numbness, loss of sensation or tingling, in both arms and legs and around your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are detached from your own body or your surroundings?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a head trauma?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Panic attack\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Anemia\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Stable angina\\n- GERD\\n- Inguinal hernia\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- SLE\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe patient is a 41-year-old male with chest pain, especially on the side and lower chest, described as a cramp-like pain, not radiating, not intense, not radiating, barely noticeable when seated, not affecting breath, not fainting, no headache, no numbness, no dizziness, no past history of migraines, no family history of migraines, no history of asthma or bronchodilator use, no recent travel, no previous head trauma, no recent medications, no recent exercise or strenuous activity, no symptoms of Scombroid food poisoning.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains inconsistencies and logical gaps in its reasoning:\n\n1. The response misinterprets the patient's pain description and intensity. The pain is described as a cramp-like, sharp, localized pain with an intensity of 7 out of 10, which contradicts the response's description of the pain as \"not intense\" and \"barely noticeable.\"\n\n2. The response disregards the fact that the pain is located in multiple areas of the chest and the right iliac fossa, yet it concludes that the chest pain is \"not due to any of the listed conditions.\" This conclusion is reached without adequately ruling out any specific conditions from the list provided.\n\n3. The reasoning leaps to NSTEMI/STEMI as the \"most likely condition,\" but this is inconsistent with the patient's overall symptom profile, particularly the lack of radiation, shortness of breath, or other typical heart attack symptoms.\n\n4. It repeatedly mentions details irrelevant to the patient's situation, such as no previous head trauma or recent exercise. These details do not logically contribute to assessing the patient's current symptoms or lead logically to the conclusion of NSTEMI/STEMI.\n\nThe INITIAL RESPONSE lacks the thoroughness needed to systematically assess the patient's symptoms against the provided options. It skips critical evaluations necessary to either confirm or rule out conditions such as a panic attack, which could align with the input's label.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
