Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 49\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - sensitive\\n    - tugging\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\n    - hypochondrium(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hiatal hernia?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had stools that were black (like coal)?\\n    - N\\nDo you think you are pregnant or are you currently pregnant?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- GERD\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Anemia\\n- Stable angina\\n- Boerhaave'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 49-year-old female with chest pain that starts in her stomach and makes it feel like coal.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE lacks consistency and displays several logical errors in the analysis:\n\n1. The response begins with misstatements: \"A 49-year-old female with chest pain that starts in her stomach and makes it feel like coal.\" The input explicitly states there is no burning sensation starting in the stomach; there is no mention of pain feeling \"like coal,\" but it does mention \"lower chest,\" \"upper chest,\" and \"hypochondrium(R)\". This suggests misinterpretation of the data.\n\n2. Options analyzed are not fully aligned with the input details. The input data indicates a pain intensity of 6 with specific locations and characteristics (haunting, sensitive, tugging, burning), none of which match \"stomach\" or \"coal.\"\n\n3. The response claims \"Stable angina does not have symptoms that fit,\" but it doesn't thoroughly justify this decision or explain the omitted symptoms that would lead to this conclusion. \n\n4. Several symptoms and questions in the input, such as cough, stool color, or pain radiating are not addressed in the conclusion.\n\n5. A final assertion that \"The most likely diagnosis is Pericarditis\" is made without addressing or excluding other possibilities given in the options, such as GERD, which could present with chest pain and was labeled as the likely diagnosis by the scenario.\n\nThe response demonstrates a lack of coherence and logical progression, failing to fully address or integrate the evidence provided in the input. Thus, it is not consistent.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
