Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 64\\nSex: M\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - pharynx\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that the tone of your voice has become deeper, softer or hoarse?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Influenza'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 64-year-old man describing his pain as burning, located in the tonsils, feels in the pharynx, is not radiating, is precise, and appears sudden.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE attempts to logically analyze the given medical symptoms and match them to the list of possible diagnoses. It steps through each option, applying reasoning based on the symptoms provided:\n\n1. The response breaks down the symptoms: burning pain in the tonsils and pharynx, described as sudden and precise, and checks those against each potential diagnosis.\n2. It rules out Bronchitis due to the sudden nature not being typical.\n3. It discounts Acute laryngitis because burning pain is not typical, although the correctness of this assertion could be debated since the provided LABEL suggests otherwise.\n4. It dismisses Tuberculosis due to lung involvement symptoms not matching.\n5. Considers Viral pharyngitis due to the pharyngeal symptoms.\n6. Eliminates Influenza due to the lack of cough and fever.\n\nThe reasoning structure is coherent and methodical, despite the discrepancy in the correct diagnosis according to the LABEL. The response lacks contradictions or unsupported assumptions and evaluates all options thoughtfully, which aligns with the consistency criteria set for this evaluation.\n\nHowever, the response should consider more deeply why Acute laryngitis might fit the symptoms, as per the LABEL. Yet, the reasoning process itself remains consistent and logical in structure based on the information interpreted by the respondent.\n\nPREDICTION: ```Yes```"
