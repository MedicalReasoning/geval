Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 34\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - a cramp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - flank(L)\\n    - hypochondrium(L)\\n    - belly\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you constantly feel fatigued or do you have non-restful sleep?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any lesions, redness or problems on your skin that you believe are related to the condition you are consulting for?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - yellow\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - N\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - Y\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHave you had an involuntary weight loss over the last 3 months?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pale stools and dark urine?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre there members of your family who have been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- GERD\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Anemia\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 34-year-old male with no history of diabetes, constant fatigue, non-restful sleep, skin lesions, and a rash.

    "prediction": "To evaluate the INITIAL RESPONSE based on the INPUT, we need to assess whether the reasoning is coherent and logically consistent.\n\n1. **Patient Details and Symptoms**: The patient is a 34-year-old male with specific symptoms, including sensitive, cramp-like pain in various areas, a yellow rash in the epigastric region, but no diabetes, fatigue, lesions, or significant itching or weight loss.\n\n2. **Analysis and Logical Flow**: The response analyzes each option for potential diagnoses:\n   - **Pancreatic Neoplasm**: Dismissed due to the absence of diabetes. However, this is an oversimplification because pancreatic neoplasms can occur without diabetes.\n   - **Anaphylaxis**: Dismissed appropriately as the symptom profile does not match typical acute allergic reactions.\n   - **GERD**: Dismissed but with a vague analysis. GERD can cause abdominal discomfort, but it wouldn't typically account for the skin rash and pain profile provided.\n   - **Scombroid Food Poisoning**: Selected as most likely due to the presence of a rash. However, the reasoning is not well substantiated given the lack of supporting symptoms such as recent fish consumption or specific histamine reactions.\n   - **Anemia**: Mentioned but warranted further analysis given the lack of symptom compatibility.\n   - **Chagas**: Dismissed possibly correctly due to lack of travel or widespread systemic symptoms typical of Chagas.\n\n3. **Final Diagnosis and Consistency**: The response concludes with Scombroid food poisoning without exhaustive reasoning to support severe rash specificity, overlooking other considerations such as dietary history.\n\nAs a result, the initial response contains several logical shortcuts, lacks detailed and methodical reasoning across each potential diagnosis, and exhibits inconsistencies in addressing relevant signs and symptoms described in the input. These logical jumps result in a less coherent analysis than required.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
