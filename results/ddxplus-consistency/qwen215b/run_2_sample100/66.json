Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 20\\nSex: M\\nHave any of your family members been diagnosed with cluster headaches?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - tugging\\n    - violent\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - eye(L)\\n    - temple(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you feel that your eyes produce excessive tears?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Cluster headache\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 20-year-old male with no family history of cluster headaches or pain related to his reason for consultation.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does consider the evidence provided in the INPUT and attempts to analyze the options. However, there is a noticeable gap in reasoning that results in an unsupported conclusion. \n\nThe person does not have a family history of cluster headaches and denies pain related specifically to his consultation, which seems contradictory given the focus on diagnosing his pain symptoms. Furthermore, the response states that \"Cluster headache: Malignant, persistent, and self-limiting,\" which is an unclear description and doesn't logically connect with the evidence provided. The other options, Chagas and Anemia, are dismissed with oversimplifications rather than a thorough rationale that interlinks the evidence effectively with the diagnosis options.\n\nTherefore, despite an attempt at logical flow, the response contains reasoning shortcuts and lacks necessary clarity and details to be consistent and coherent. This indicates gaps present in logical progression towards the deduction of the diagnosis of \"Cluster headache.\"\n\nPREDICTION```No```"
