Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 49\\nSex: M\\nHave any of your family members been diagnosed with cluster headaches?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - violent\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - eye(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel that your eyes produce excessive tears?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Cluster headache'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe patient presents with headache-like pain in the forehead, cheek (right and left), temple (left), and eye (right) with a 9/10 intensity, no radiating pain, located at a precise 8 (out of 10), and no excessive alcohol consumption or addiction.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nCluster headache: Fits the description with location of pain and intensity of 9/10.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is Cluster headache.\n\n```Cluster headache```\n\nLABEL:\nCluster headache\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE evaluates the patient's symptoms with a structured approach. It first outlines the salient points of the patient's pain experience: locations affected, intensity, and lack of radiating pain. This step-by-step breakdown is consistent with the presented evidence. It then logically compares the symptoms against the potential diagnosis of a \"Cluster headache,\" which is indeed characterized by severe, localized pain often around the eye and temple regions.\n\nHowever, the analysis is somewhat superficial and doesn't thoroughly consider all aspects, such as the \"haunting\" and \"violent\" characterization of the pain or other possible conditions that could fit the evidence provided. The reasoning does not explore alternative diagnoses or explicitly consider why certain symptoms might align or not align with them. Still, fundamentally, the response is coherent and logically progresses from presenting symptoms to a probable diagnosis without contradictions or unreasonable leaps.\n\nGiven these considerations, the INITIAL RESPONSE maintains consistency through its concise conclusion, though it could have been more comprehensive in its analysis.\n\n```PREDICTION```Yes```"
