Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 63\\nSex: F\\nDo you feel anxious?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a cramp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - flank(L)\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are (or were) choking or suffocating?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with depression?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel lightheaded and dizzy or do you feel like you are about to faint?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a migraine or is a member of your family known to have migraines?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are dying or were you afraid that you were about do die?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from fibromyalgia?\\n    - N\\nAre you feeling nauseous or do you feel like vomiting?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had numbness, loss of sensation or tingling, in both arms and legs and around your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are detached from your own body or your surroundings?\\n    - N\\nDo you currently, or did you ever, have numbness, loss of sensitivity or tingling anywhere on your body?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Panic attack\\n- PSVT\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Anemia\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Stable angina\\n- GERD\\n- Inguinal hernia\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Chagas\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 63-year-old female who had a recent cholecystectomy and now feels anxious about her new lower chest pain.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates multiple inconsistencies and inaccuracies when evaluated against the INPUT:\n\n1. **Introduction of extraneous information:** The INITIAL RESPONSE introduces the fact that the patient had a recent cholecystectomy, which is not mentioned in the INPUT provided. This extraneous information significantly alters the context within which the diagnoses are evaluated.\n\n2. **Irrelevant analysis based on incorrect assumptions:** The reasoning heavily focuses on the effects of a supposed cholecystectomy, affecting the evaluation of each listed option's relevance based on incorrect foundational assumptions. This change in context invalidates much of the subsequent reasoning.\n\n3. **Inappropriate conclusion:** Given the patient's symptoms in the INPUT, especially the significant chest pain without anxiety or shortness of breath, the conclusion of a \"Panic attack\" seems unsupported. According to the INPUT, the patient does not feel anxious ('Do you feel anxious?' has a response of 'N'), undermining the rationale for selecting Panic attack.\n\n4. **Misinterpretation of symptom importance:** The reasoning fails to adequately address the specified painful areas and intensity (rated 7), which should have been critical in narrowing down significant medical conditions rather than attributing it to anxiety that the patient denies experiencing.\n\nThe analysis, therefore, bypasses significant logical steps and conclusions that are expected based on the provided symptoms and evidence. \n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
