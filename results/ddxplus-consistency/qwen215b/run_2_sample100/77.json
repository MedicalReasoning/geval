Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 79\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the neck(R)\\n    - side of the neck(L)\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - occiput\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel so tired that you are unable to do your usual activities or are you stuck in your bed all day long?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any lesions, redness or problems on your skin that you believe are related to the condition you are consulting for?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - pink\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - N\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - back of the neck\\n    - side of the neck(L)\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - Y\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you immunosuppressed?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Influenza\\n- Bronchitis\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Chagas\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 79-year-old man with no history of smoking, symptoms of pain in the side of the neck and top of the head, and no fever or sore throat.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE follows a systematic approach, laying out the patient's symptoms and systematically ruling out potential conditions. However, it fails to conclusively justify why Acute rhinosinusitis is preferred over Influenza. Although the patient does not exhibit classic symptoms of the flu, such as fever or sore throat, neither does he show specific symptoms exclusivly tied to Acute rhinosinusitis. Key factors like the lack of respiratory symptoms or nasal issues are not leveraged to fully eliminate possibilities nor clearly favor others. While the INITIAL RESPONSE aligns parts of the reasoning, it lacks depth in unraveling symptom-disease alignment comprehensively and convincingly, given Influenza was indicated as the correct label. Thus, it doesn't maintain complete consistency in the logical assessment and conclusion based on the provided INPUT.\n\n```PREDICTION```No"
