Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 50\\nSex: M\\nDo you feel anxious?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a cramp\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - flank(L)\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\n    - hypochondrium(R)\\n    - pubis\\n    - belly\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with depression?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from chronic anxiety?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel lightheaded and dizzy or do you feel like you are about to faint?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a migraine or is a member of your family known to have migraines?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are dying or were you afraid that you were about do die?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nAre you feeling nauseous or do you feel like vomiting?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had numbness, loss of sensation or tingling, in both arms and legs and around your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are detached from your own body or your surroundings?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a head trauma?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Panic attack\\n- PSVT\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Anemia\\n- Boerhaave\\n- GERD\\n- Inguinal hernia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 50-year-old man with significant anxiety, sweating, and pain in the right flank mentions the \"cramp\" pain.

    "prediction": "The initial response contains several inconsistencies and inaccuracies based on the provided input. First, the response begins by describing symptoms such as \"significant anxiety, sweating,\" and \"numbness and tingling,\" which contradicts the input evidences, as the person answered \"No\" to these symptoms. Furthermore, the mention of \"cramp\" pain isn't a primary focus in the input, as there is no \"significant\" mention aside from listing pain descriptions. Thus, this creates a gap in logic as understanding and analyzing symptoms inaccurately leads to incorrect deduction. Moreover, the argument for diagnosing an inguinal hernia does not sufficiently connect with any of the given symptoms or options provided, especially as \"pain\" isn't stated to radiate, go anywhere, or align precisely with the characteristic presentation of an inguinal hernia. Instead, the evidence more logically aligns with concerns like panic attack which wasn't discussed thoroughly in the response. Overall, the response overlooks and inaccurately portrays the input evidence resulting in unsupported assumptions.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
