Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 64\\nSex: M\\nDo you have metastatic cancer?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heartbreaking\\n    - haunting\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - violent\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - upper chest\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nAre you being treated for osteoporosis?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nDo you have intense coughing fits?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased with movement?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Whooping cough\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Boerhaave\\n- GERD\\n- Stable angina\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThis patient is 64 years old with metastatic cancer, no pain, and a pain characterized as a \"heartbreaking.\" He does not feel pain in specific locations like chest, side, or upper.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE misinterprets key elements of the INPUT. The response incorrectly states that the patient has metastatic cancer and no pain, which contradicts the provided information where the patient does not have metastatic cancer and reports various forms of chest pain, with an intensity of 6 on a 10-point scale. Furthermore, the INITIAL RESPONSE claims that the pain does not radiate, whereas the INPUT indicates it radiates to both sides of the posterior chest wall. These inconsistencies lead the INITIAL RESPONSE to an unfounded conclusion that a spontaneous rib fracture is the only plausible diagnosis. Therefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and logical consistency in reasoning, failing to provide a methodical analysis based on the INPUT data.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
