Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 28\\nSex: F\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - forehead\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Influenza\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 28-year-old female with a sore throat, diffuse muscle pain, nasal congestion, and a cough without cough producing colored or more abundant sputum. \n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- URTI: Commonly presents with fever and cold symptoms.\n\n- Bronchitis: Common in smokers and has symptoms of cough and sore throat.\n\n- Pneumonia: Presents with fever, cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath.\n\n- Influenza: Viral infection, typically presenting with fever and body aches.\n\n- Cluster headache: Sharp, severe, and frequent pain.\n\n- Bronchiectasis: Chronic cough and prolonged effort produces sputum.\n\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis: Chronic inflamed sinusitis.\n\n- Acute rhinosinusitis: Inflammation of the nasal passages.\n\n- Chagas: Anemia and heart failure.\n\n- Anemia: Red blood cell count below normal.\n\nNotably, the symptoms suggest a viral infection, which fits best with URTI.\n\n```URTI```\n\nLABEL:\nURTI\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains notable inconsistencies with the INPUT. Upon reviewing the INPUT, it is clear the 28-year-old female does not report having a sore throat, diffuse muscle pain, nasal congestion, or a cough. The only reported symptoms are pain in the forehead and temple with an intensity of 7 on a scale of 0 to 10, characterized as tedious. Therefore, the assumption of symptoms leading to the diagnosis of URTI is inconsistent with the provided evidence. Furthermore, the diagnosis process outlined in the response is not logically connected to the given data, making the conclusion unsupported. The logic in the response is flawed as it includes assumptions about symptoms not present, and fails to address the relevant symptom of headache, which may point to another condition like a cluster headache. Therefore, due to these inconsistencies and the lack of a logical flow based on the given evidence, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks logical coherence.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
