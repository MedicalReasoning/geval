Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 49\\nSex: M\\nHave you started or taken any antipsychotic medication within the last 7 days?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever felt like you were suffocating for a very short time associated with inability to breathe or speak?\\n    - N\\nHave you been treated in hospital recently for nausea, agitation, intoxication or aggressive behavior and received medication via an intravenous or intramuscular route?\\n    - N\\nDo you have trouble keeping your tongue in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hard time opening/raising one or both eyelids?\\n    - N\\nDo you have annoying muscle spasms in your face, neck or any other part of your body?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 49-year-old male without any symptoms or treatment history, indicating either no exposure to antipsychotic medications or a different diagnosis, consistent with a diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis.\n\n```Myasthenia gravis```\n\nLABEL:\nAcute dystonic reactions\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE attempts to determine a diagnosis from the given options based on the medical history provided in the INPUT. However, it lacks coherence and logic due to several factors. \n\n1. It jumps directly to a conclusion without properly evaluating all the relevant symptoms and matching them to the possible options. For instance, it does not address why Acute dystonic reactions were not considered.\n2. The response discusses exposure to antipsychotic medication, which is irrelevant because the INPUT clearly states the individual hasn't taken any such medication in the last 7 days and doesnâ€™t mention any past exposure.\n3. The term \"consistent with a diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis\" is stated without critiquing the symptoms associated in the INPUT. There are no mentions of symptoms typical to Myasthenia Gravis, such as fluctuating muscle weakness, in the provided evidences.\n4. It provides an incorrect conclusion as per the LABEL provided. Myasthenia Gravis is chosen instead of the correct option \"Acute dystonic reactions.\"\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE is marked by significant gaps in reasoning and does not offer a structured or justified rationale for its diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis given the evidences presented.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
