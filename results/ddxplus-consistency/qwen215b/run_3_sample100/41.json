Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 26\\nSex: M\\nIs your nose or the back of your throat itchy?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe itching in one or both eyes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live in in a big city?\\n    - N\\nAre you more likely to develop common allergies than the general population?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Allergic sinusitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Influenza'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe given information suggests a patient with no symptoms of common allergies, traveling less than 4 weeks, and living in a non-big city.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE evaluates the provided data through a consideration of various health conditions. However, it demonstrates substantial logical inconsistencies and gaps in reasoning:\n\n1. Influenza, described inaccurately in the response as a \"common cold,\" which is technically incorrect since the common cold is often caused by rhinoviruses, while influenza is caused by influenza viruses and tends to be more severe.\n2. There is no rationale for excluding the other options thoroughly, particularly Allergic sinusitis, which is labeled as the correct diagnosis. The response incorrectly associates allergies primarily with travel history, which misses the context of the question and provided patient information.\n3. It concludes Bronchitis is the most likely diagnosis without supporting evidence. The provided symptoms checklist (lacking cough, congestion, etc.) does not align with typical Bronchitis symptoms, which usually include a cough.\n4. Some comparisons or reasoning are omitted, such as fully exploring the lack of symptoms associated with Bronchitis or differentiating more accurately between conditions like URTI and Allergic sinusitis without proper justification.\n5. Finally, the reasoning inaccurately jumps to a conclusion without a sufficiently logical argumentation trail for ruling out all possible conditions cohesively.\n\nGiven these points, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence, displays logical gaps, and does not systematically analyze the INPUT as required.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
