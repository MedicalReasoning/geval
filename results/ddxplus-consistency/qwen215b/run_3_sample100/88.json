Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 21\\nSex: M\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- PSVT\\n- Anemia\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 21-year-old male with no known heart valve issues, COPD, shortness of breath, diabetes, significant overweight, slight dizziness, and no heart attack history.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE begins by accurately listing the patient's symptoms and conditions based on the evidence provided. However, the step-by-step reasoning contains several inconsistencies and logical gaps. For instance, the response claims that certain conditions like \"Anemia\" are common with COPD, which is disconnected from the patient who doesn't have COPD. Additionally, the mention of \"Panic attack\" as unlikely due to \"recent travel\" is illogical, as the travel-related condition suggested was \"Scombroid food poisoning,\" not panic attacks. Moreover, the conclusion that panic attack is the \"most likely diagnosis\" seems unsupported by the provided symptoms, as panic attacks are typically associated with palpitations, which the patient does not have. Furthermore, it disregards \"Atrial fibrillation,\" the correct label, without providing sufficient rationale for the decision.\n\nTherefore, the response demonstrates a lack of coherence and logical consistency, with evident gaps and flaws in its reasoning.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
