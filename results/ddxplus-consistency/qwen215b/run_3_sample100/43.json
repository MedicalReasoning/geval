Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 75\\nSex: M\\nAre you currently taking or have you recently taken anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)?\\n    - N\\nDo you take corticosteroids?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - sensitive\\n    - tugging\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - ankle(R)\\n    - ankle(L)\\n    - thigh(L)\\n    - sole(R)\\n    - sole(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHave you gained weight recently?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have liver cirrhosis?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had surgery to remove lymph nodes?\\n    - N\\nDo you take a calcium channel blockers (medication)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have swelling in one or more areas of your body?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - ankle(R)\\n    - ankle(L)\\n    - thigh(R)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(R)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(L)\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Localized edema\\n- Chagas\\n- Anaphylaxis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 75-year-old man with pain in his right and left ankle, thigh, and sole, feeling like a tugging sensation and a dull pain, with no swelling in recent days.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inconsistencies and logical gaps in relation to the INPUT provided. \n\nFirstly, the response inaccurately states that the patient has \"no swelling in recent days,\" whereas the INPUT provides evidence of swelling located at both ankles, right thigh, and dorsal aspects of both feet. This misinterpretation is critical because the presence of swelling directly relates to evaluating the possibility of localized edema.\n\nSecondly, the response claims that the patient \"takes calcium channel blockers,\" although it is explicitly stated in the INPUT that the patient does not take such medication. This error signifies neglect in accurately utilizing the given data.\n\nMoreover, while the reasoning attempts to analyze the potential causes—localized edema, Chagas, and anaphylaxis—it falls short of addressing all the provided evidence systematically, and it does not thoroughly differentiate between the given options based on the detailed evidence.\n\nTherefore, due to these logical issues and the failure to thoroughly and accurately engage with INPUT data, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks consistency.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
