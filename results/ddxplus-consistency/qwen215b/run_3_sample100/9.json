Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 38\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - exhausting\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - biceps(R)\\n    - biceps(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - thoracic spine\\n    - shoulder(R)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you constantly feel fatigued or do you have non-restful sleep?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you exercise regularly, 4 times per week or more?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that are increased with physical exertion but alleviated with rest?\\n    - N\\nDo you have close family members who had a cardiovascular disease problem before the age of 50?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Panic attack\\n- Anemia\\n- GERD\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- SLE\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Chagas\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- PSVT\\n- Pulmonary embolism'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 38-year-old female with a characterizing chest pain of tiredness and exhaustion in the left side of the chest, with a painless discomfort localized to the left side of the chest with a dull ache and a 5 on a scale of 1-10.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inconsistencies and misinterpretations of the INPUT data, which undermine its coherence and logical consistency:\n\n1. The summary in the initial response contains factual inaccuracies, such as the claim that the pain does \"not radiate anywhere,\" while the input specifies radiation to several locations.\n\n2. The response states the pain \"appears quickly,\" but this doesn't fully align with the input which rates the speed of pain appearance as 5 on a scale of 10, suggesting moderate onset.\n\n3. The response omits or incorrectly summarizes critical characteristics of the pain, like its bilateral aspects, located on both the sides of the chest and other areas mentioned in the input, which could significantly affect the diagnosis.\n\n4. The understanding of symptoms and criteria for mentions of specific diagnoses like \"unstable angina\" is not sufficiently justified in the context of the input. There are inconsistencies with provided evidence, like shortness of breath and pain alleviated with rest that are typical markers for cardiac issues, specifically types of angina, which have not been addressed properly in accordance with the input details.\n\nDue to these inconsistencies, flawed interpretations, and unsupported conclusions, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not exhibit consistency with the given input, thereby warranting a \"No\" decision:\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
