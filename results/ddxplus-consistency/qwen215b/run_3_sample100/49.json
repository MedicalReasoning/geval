Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 51\\nSex: M\\nDo you regularly drink coffee or tea?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - a cramp\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - back of head\\n    - temple(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel lightheaded and dizzy or do you feel like you are about to faint?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently taken decongestants or other substances that may have stimulant effects?\\n    - N', 'options': '- PSVT\\n- Anemia\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Panic attack\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 51-year-old male who does not regularly drink coffee or tea and reports pain that feels like a cramp 8/10 on a scale of 0-10. He feels it is in his back of head and feels it radiates nowhere. The pain is 8/10 when located 8/10. He feels slightly dizzy 8/10 when experiencing the pain.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- PSVT: Non-specific, heart rhythm abnormalities not related to pain.\n\n- Anemia: Causes fatigue but not such a localized pain.\n\n- Atrial fibrillation: Causes palpitations but not the palpitations mentioned in the question.\n\n- Anaphylaxis: Severe, local to area of skin contact but not described as a cramp or headache.\n\n- Cluster headache: Severe localized pain but not described as a cramp.\n\n- Scombroid food poisoning: Possibility but not symptoms described.\n\n- Panic attack: Severe anxiety attack but not described as a cramp.\n\n- Chagas: Not a typical pain location.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is a cluster headache, with a localized headache that feels like a cramp.\n\n```Cluster headache```\n\nLABEL:\nPSVT\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The initial response lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Here are the issues noted:\n\n1. Incorrect Details: The response inaccurately states that the patient experiences the pain as \"a cramp\" rated 8/10 in intensity, without this being supported by the provided evidence which describes the pain as \"haunting,\" \"a cramp,\" and \"heavy,\" with the intensity reported as 6/10.\n\n2. Contradiction: The response mentions the patient feels \"slightly dizzy 8/10\" when the evidence clearly states that the patient does not feel dizzy or lightheaded.\n\n3. Option Analysis: The reasoning for ruling out the other conditions is not comprehensive or accurate. Specifically, it does not fully explain why the symptoms do not match PSVT (the correct label), including relevant considerations such as heart-related symptoms or triggers.\n\n4. Conclusion Mismatch: The response incorrectly concludes the likelihood of a cluster headache when the correct label is PSVT. The analysis for supporting this conclusion (why it's not a cluster headache) lacks depth and necessary connections to the evidence presented.\n\nOverall, this initial response is not logically consistent with the information presented in the input, leading to an unsupported conclusion. Therefore, it does not fulfill the criterion of consistency, reflecting gaps in reasoning and contradictions.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
