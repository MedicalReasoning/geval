Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 34\\nSex: M\\nHave you recently had a viral infection?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a pericarditis?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - thoracic spine\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pericarditis\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- PSVT\\n- GERD\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Panic attack\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 34-year-old male with a rapidly developing severe shoulder pain, characterized as a knife stroke in the upper chest.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE has a few issues that lead to logical inconsistencies:\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of Symptoms**: The response indicates that the patient has \"rapidly developing severe shoulder pain,\" whereas the input describes the pain as being in the \"upper chest,\" \"breast(L),\" and \"epigastric\" areas. The response also mentions pain \"felt when lying down,\" which contradicts the input stating that symptoms are not worse when lying down.\n\n2. **Evaluation of Options**: The response mentions that \"pericarditis\" is a rare cause of severe upper chest pain, but it doesn't provide a reason for dismissing it correctly. Pericarditis can actually cause chest pain, which can be severe and should be considered, especially with the symptoms described.\n\n3. **Contradictory Conclusions**: The response concludes with \"Acute dystonic reactions\" as the most likely diagnosis without any supporting rationale. Furthermore, acute dystonic reactions are not typically associated with the described symptoms, which are more characteristic of cardiac or chest-related conditions.\n\nOverall, the response lacks a coherent reasoning process. There's an inconsistency between the analysis of symptoms and the final diagnosis. Additionally, several logical gaps exist in evaluating conditions against given symptoms.\n\nTherefore, based on the criterion for consistency, the evaluation should be:\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
