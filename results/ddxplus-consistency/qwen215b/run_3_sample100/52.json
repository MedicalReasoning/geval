Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 27\\nSex: F\\nAre you infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - sickening\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - biceps(R)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - thoracic spine\\n    - shoulder(R)\\n    - shoulder(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high cholesterol or do you take medications to treat high cholesterol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high blood pressure or do you take medications to treat high blood pressure?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a problem with poor circulation?\\n    - N\\nAre you feeling nauseous or do you feel like vomiting?\\n    - N\\nAre you a former smoker?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have close family members who had a cardiovascular disease problem before the age of 50?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- GERD\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- Chagas\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Panic attack\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 27-year-old female who is not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus and reports no pain or shortness of breath.

    "prediction": "1. The initial response highlights a series of thought processes step by step related to the input. The response correctly summarizes the patient's conditions and acknowledges the relevant fields such as age, sex, pain description, and potential symptoms or history for diagnosis purposes. \n\n2. The initial response evaluates each potential diagnosis, listing reasons primarily tied to age group probabilities rather than the provided symptoms such as chest pain intensity and location detailed in the input. It states that certain conditions like NSTEMI / STEMI, anaphylaxis, or panic attacks are rare in the age group but fails to consider symptoms like high-intensity chest pain that could point to these conditions regardless of the patient's age. This oversight leads to gaps in the diagnostic reasoning.\n\n3. The response prematurely settles on Sarcoidosis as the potential diagnosis. It provides no clear explanation, through the symptoms or explicit connections to this condition in comparison to the other diagnoses, especially given that the task asks to select the possibility of NSTEMI / STEMI, which the response immediately dismisses.\n\n4. Overall, the flow of reasoning from evidence to diagnosis seems inadequate due to these omissions and a lack of a methodical analysis of symptoms specifically correlated with possibilities like NSTEMI / STEMI.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
