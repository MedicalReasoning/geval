Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 55\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - palace\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 55-year-old female with no history of similar symptoms in the last 2 weeks, living alone, attending a daycare, mild pain in her tonsils (tonsil(R) or tonsil(L)), and a burning pain localized to her jaw.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE evaluation based on the criterion for consistency is:\n\nThe INITIAL RESPONSE starts by mentioning that the person is living alone and attending a daycare, whereas the INPUT clearly states the opposite: the individual does not live with 4 or more people nor attend a daycare. This is a critical inconsistency. Furthermore, the analysis part has another notable discrepancy. It incorrectly identifies \"URTI\" as a urinary tract infection (rather than an upper respiratory tract infection), leading to an erroneous dismissal based on symptoms. Moreover, the response jumps to a conclusion of stable angina without reasoning that truly aligns with the symptoms mentioned in the INPUT. It also dismisses other possibilities without a clear justification, particularly for viral pharyngitis, which is the correct label according to the INPUT. \n\nThese errors indicate gaps in logical consistency and a lack of proper coherence in reasoning. The INITIAL RESPONSE does not methodically address the symptoms in relation to the options provided, leading to an unsupported conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the evaluation of consistency for the INITIAL RESPONSE is:\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
