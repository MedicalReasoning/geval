Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 66\\nSex: F\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - occiput\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Influenza\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchitis\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Chagas\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 66-year-old woman with increased sweating, no pain associated, and subjective heavy pain on the top of the head, cheek(R), cheek(L), and occiput.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE begins by inaccurately summarizing the patient's symptoms, mentioning increased sweating and no associated pain, while the patient described \"heavy\" pain in multiple areas as the main concern. The response also claims the patient has \"increased sweating,\" which is incorrect according to the INPUT evidence.\n\nAs the response analyzes each diagnostic option, several inconsistencies arise. For example, URTI is noted as common in children without linking it to this patient's age or symptoms. The response also quickly dismisses other conditions like Influenza, Pneumonia, and others without properly addressing relevant symptoms like the described head and facial pain. \n\nMost importantly, the decision to conclude URTI as the diagnosis lacks reasoning linked directly to the evidence presented. Instead, it relies on a brief mention of typical features when a more detailed evaluation would better serve the task.\n\nIn summary, the response does show inconsistencies and lacks a rigorous application of logical reasoning with respect to the presented symptoms. \n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
