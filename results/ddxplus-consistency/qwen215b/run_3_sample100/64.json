Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 64\\nSex: M\\nDo you have metastatic cancer?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heartbreaking\\n    - haunting\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - violent\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - upper chest\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nAre you being treated for osteoporosis?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nDo you have intense coughing fits?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased with movement?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Whooping cough\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Boerhaave\\n- GERD\\n- Stable angina\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThis patient is 64 years old with metastatic cancer, no pain, and a pain characterized as a \"heartbreaking.\" He does not feel pain in specific locations like chest, side, or upper.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits several inconsistencies and logical gaps when compared to the INPUT data provided. Firstly, it inaccurately mentions \"the patient has metastatic cancer\" while the INPUT clearly states the patient does not have metastatic cancer (\"Do you have metastatic cancer? - N\"). Secondly, the response contradicts itself by stating the patient has no pain when the INPUT includes multiple characterizations of pain, its location, intensity (6), and the pain radiating, which is not addressed coherently. The reasoning seems to miss the logical connections necessary to derive the potential diagnosis. Given this information mismatch and the logical disconnects in addressing all patient conditions, the diagnosis of \"Spontaneous rib fracture\" appears speculative without rigorous methodical support within the response.\n\nThe evaluation against the criterion clearly suggests that the INITIAL RESPONSE does not meet the expectations of consistency as defined. There are contradictions and skips in logical steps crucial to a coherent analysis.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
