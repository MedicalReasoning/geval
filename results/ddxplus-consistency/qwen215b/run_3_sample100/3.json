Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 45\\nSex: F\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - occiput\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Influenza\\n- URTI\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 45-year-old female not living with family or attending daycare.

    "prediction": "In evaluating the INITIAL RESPONSE based on the criterion of Consistency, we observe the following:\n\n1. **Incorrect Analysis of Options**: The response incorrectly claims that certain conditions (Pneumonia, Bronchitis, Influenza, URTI, Tuberculosis, Bronchiectasis, and Chagas) are not listed in the options, despite them being present in the options provided in the INPUT. \n   \n2. **Contradiction in Pain Description**: The INITIAL RESPONSE states, \"Pain is not 'sensitive.'\" However, the INPUT notes the pain is characterized as \"sensitive.\" This is a direct contradiction that undermines the coherence of the response.\n\n3. **Incomplete Analysis**: The response does not thoroughly analyze or link all symptoms and considerations from the INPUT to the listed options. A focus on headaches and absence of respiratory symptoms should prompt a reevaluation of conditions like \"URTI\" which was the given label.\n\n4. **Inaccurate Diagnosis**: The response concludes with a diagnosis of Influenza without sufficiently demonstrating why it fits the symptoms described, especially given the absence of fever and cough.\n\nThe overall reasoning and logical progression of the INITIAL RESPONSE are flawed due to contradictions, misrepresentation of given data, and a lack of thorough analysis to reach the given conclusion. Therefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and significant consistency.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
