Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 51\\nSex: M\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high blood pressure or do you take medications to treat high blood pressure?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known heart defect?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating very irregularly or in a disorganized pattern?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Atrial fibrillation'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 51-year-old male with no known history of heart issues, high blood pressure, a heart attack or angina, no heart defect, no palpitations, no heart racing, no irregular heartbeats, no travel history.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Fits history.\n\n```Atrial fibrillation```\n\nLABEL:\nAtrial fibrillation\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

The individual described in the INPUT does not show any symptoms or conditions that align with atrial fibrillation, as it is stated that there are no known heart issues, high blood pressure, or any symptoms such as palpitations, heart racing, or irregular heartbeats. Concluding \"Atrial fibrillation: Fits history\" is incorrect and inconsistent with the evidence given, which contradicts the conclusion drawn in the response. Therefore, the initial response lacks coherence, relies on unsupported assumptions, and makes a leap in logic that undermines its overall validity.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
