Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 23\\nSex: M\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 23-year-old male with no history of contact, no living with multiple people, no pain related to the reason for consulting, no sensitive/nerve pain, no tonsil, thyroid cartilage, or pharynx pain, no jaw pain, no radiating pain, no precise location, no speed of onset, no nasal congestion, no travel, and no signs of a heart problem.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE is inconsistent with the INPUT provided as it contains several inaccuracies and logical inconsistencies:\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of Symptoms**: The INITIAL RESPONSE misinterprets the symptoms described in the INPUT. It states \"no pain related to the reason for consulting, no sensitive/nerve pain, no tonsil, thyroid cartilage, or pharynx pain, no jaw pain,\" while the INPUT clearly specifies pain in locations such as \"tonsil(R),\" \"thyroid cartilage,\" \"palace,\" \"pharynx,\" and \"under the jaw\" with an intensity of 7. \n\n2. **Incorrect Analysis of Options**: The INPUT also does not suggest symptoms consistent with NSTEMI/STEMI. The patient is young, without typical risk factors or typical chest pain symptoms, which makes the response illogical since NSTEMI/STEMI typically presents with chest pain and is more common in older individuals with risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, etc.\n\n3. **Ignoring Relevant Symptoms**: The INITIAL RESPONSE overlooks symptoms related to Viral pharyngitis, such as the location and nature of the throat pain, even though it fits better given the evidence of pharynx and tonsil pain without any significant cardiac symptoms.\n\nOverall, the reasoning is poorly structured, overlooks key symptoms described in the INPUT, and suggests an improbable diagnosis without adequate justification, leading to a conclusion that contradicts the expected answer (Viral pharyngitis).\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
