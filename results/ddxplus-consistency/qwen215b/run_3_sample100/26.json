Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 26\\nSex: F\\nDo you feel your abdomen is bloated or distended (swollen due to pressure from inside)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\n    - iliac fossa(L)\\n    - hip(R)\\n    - hip(L)\\n    - testicle(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - NA\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - N\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - N\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have intense coughing fits?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Inguinal hernia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 26-year-old female with abdominal bloating and pain in the iliac fossa without any other symptoms.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains inconsistencies in its evaluation and diagnosis. The summary of the evidence is not accurate, as it mentions abdominal bloating, which the patient denies experiencing in the INPUT. Additionally, it fails to logically analyze the options provided, specifically why an inguinal hernia is considered the most likely diagnosis despite it being less likely, according to the initial response itself. Further, the response skips evaluating certain pain locations provided in the evidence, such as pain in both iliac fossae and both hips, which could be relevant to diagnosing an inguinal hernia. Overall, the logic flow is disrupted by inconsistencies and gaps, particularly the unexplained inconsistency regarding the likelihood of an inguinal hernia.\n\nTherefore, the verdict is consistent with the \"No\" label as the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence in logic and reasoning. \n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
