Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 49\\nSex: F\\nDo you have an active cancer?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - scapula(R)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you currently take hormones?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - nowhere\\nDid you lose consciousness?\\n    - N\\nHave you had surgery within the last month?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America', 'options': '- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Panic attack\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Ebola\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 49-year-old female with symptoms of coughing up blood, pain on the side of the chest, sensitivity to pain, and shortness of breath.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE analyzes the given symptoms and evidence step-by-step, considering the possible diagnoses presented in the options. However, there are several logical inconsistencies:\n\n1. The person in the INPUT denies experiencing shortness of breath, coughing up blood, or related pain, but the INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly states that she has symptoms of coughing up blood, pain, and shortness of breath.\n\n2. The INITIAL RESPONSE concludes with \"The most probable diagnosis is Acute pulmonary edema\" despite acknowledging that acute pulmonary edema often causes difficulty breathing. Yet, the patient does not experience significant breathing difficulty, weakening this conclusion.\n\n3. The analysis of some conditions, such as pulmonary embolism, is not thoroughly explored despite it fitting the given evidence better (e.g., age, pain location, and characteristics) than acute pulmonary edema given the absence of shortness of breath.\n\nIn summary, the response presents inconsistencies in symptom reporting and logical gaps in reasoning to support its final diagnosis. Therefore, it lacks coherence and does not address the INPUT thoroughly or accurately.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
