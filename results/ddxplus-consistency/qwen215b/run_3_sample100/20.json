Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 51\\nSex: M\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - pharynx\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- URTI\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 51-year-old male with no past history of similar symptoms, not attending or working in a daycare, no pain that relates to his reason for consultation, no tonsillitis, no thyroid cartilage, no pharynx pain, no pain radiating to another location, no precise pain location, no pain appearing suddenly, no smoking, no nasal congestion or clear runny nose, no cough, no travel in the last 4 weeks.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nViral pharyngitis: No tonsillitis or throat pain, fits poorly.\n\nBronchitis: No pharynx, fits poorly.\n\nAcute laryngitis: No tonsillitis or throat pain.\n\nURTIs: Fits poorly.\n\nPossible NSTEMI / STEMI: Fits poorly.\n\nUnstable angina: Fits poorly.\n\nStable angina: No symptoms.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is Viral pharyngitis.\n\n```Viral pharyngitis```\n\nLABEL:\nViral pharyngitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The initial response contains several inconsistencies and a lack of coherence in its reasoning process. It lists various symptoms and questions, but then incorrectly states that there is no pain related to the reason for consultation, contradicting the provided input which mentions intense pain in the tonsil, thyroid cartilage, and pharynx. The statement \"no tonsillitis, no thyroid cartilage, no pharynx pain\" is a misinterpretation of the given evidence where these are precisely the locations of pain. Additionally, it claims no throat pain, which contradicts the precise and intense pain described in the input.\n\nFurthermore, the response does not logically connect these observations with the listed options, failing to justify the conclusion of Viral pharyngitis effectively. The decision-making process is flawed due to these inconsistencies and lack of consideration for all relevant symptoms.\n\nThus, due to these gaps in logic and incorrect interpretation of the symptoms provided in the input, the initial response should be rated as lacking consistency.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
