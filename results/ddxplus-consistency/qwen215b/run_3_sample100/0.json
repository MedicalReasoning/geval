Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 35\\nSex: F\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you had a cold in the last 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that the tone of your voice has become deeper, softer or hoarse?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute laryngitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Epiglottitis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe patient reports throat pain, tonsillar pain, and difficulty swallowing. The pain is described as sensitive and burning. The patient does not smoke, feel fever, cough, or have traveled during the last few weeks.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAcute laryngitis: Can cause throat pain.\n\nBronchitis: Can present with cough and sore throat.\n\nTuberculosis: Can induce fever and cough. However, the patient does not have fever, cough, or throat pain.\n\nEpiglottitis: Not usually associated with throat pain or pharyngeal symptoms.\n\nViral pharyngitis: Can cause throat pain and other common symptoms. However, the patient does not have fever.\n\nPossible NSTEMI / STEMI: Refers to myocardial ischemia, which can mimic throat pain but is more severe and would require immediate medical attention.\n\nUnstable angina: Can lead to chest pain but usually does not meet the patient's criteria.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis based on the symptoms provided is: Acute laryngitis.\n\n```Acute laryngitis```\n\nLABEL:\nAcute laryngitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

However, some flaws exist in its reasoning:\n\n1. It incorrectly states that the patient reports \"difficulty swallowing,\" which is not mentioned in the INPUT.\n2. It claims Tuberculosis requires \"throat pain,\" which contradicts its prior note stating Tuberculosis lacks associated throat pain.\n3. It imposes fever to rule out Viral pharyngitis, despite the potential for pharyngitis sans fever.\n\nWhile the INITIAL RESPONSE methodically examines each provided diagnostic option concerning symptoms, these inaccuracies dampen its consistency.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
