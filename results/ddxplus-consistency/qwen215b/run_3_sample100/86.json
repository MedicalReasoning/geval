Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 57\\nSex: F\\nHave you been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known heart defect?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating very irregularly or in a disorganized pattern?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that are increased with physical exertion but alleviated with rest?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Atrial fibrillation\\n- PSVT\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Panic attack\\n- Anemia\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 57-year-old female without known heart valve issues, COPD, or previous heart issues, who experienced shortness of breath and slight dizziness.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE evaluates the condition of a 57-year-old female considering various medical conditions. However, there are several inconsistencies compared to the INPUT:\n\n1. The response incorrectly states that the individual experienced shortness of breath and dizziness, while the INPUT clearly indicates \"N\" (No) for both. This misinterpretation affects the entire logical reasoning.\n\n2. In analyzing the options, the response incorrectly describes \"PSVT\" as \"Pectus Sternal Vibra Triae,\" which is not a recognized medical condition associated with PSVT. PSVT stands for Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia, which relates to episodes of rapid heart rate.\n\n3. The conclusion suggests Panic attack as the likely diagnosis without thoroughly addressing other symptoms or contradictions in reasoning, such as the lack of anxiety-related symptoms provided in the INPUT.\n\n4. The analysis of Atrial fibrillation is incorrect as well, stating it is not commonly associated with shortness of breath, which is inconsistent with the medical understanding of atrial fibrillation.\n\nThe logical flow is compromised due to misinterpretation and incorrect associations, leading to a flawed conclusion and inconsistent response.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
