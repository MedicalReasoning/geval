Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 6\\nSex: F\\nDo you have an active cancer?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nHave you been unable to move or get up for more than 3 consecutive days within the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have swelling in one or more areas of your body?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - posterior aspect of the ankle(L)\\n    - calf(L)\\nHave you had surgery within the last month?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 6-year-old female with coughing up blood and pain in the side of the chest, associated with a sharp sensation.

The pain is not increased by breathing.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nPulmonary embolism: Can present with shortness of breath and pain in the side of the chest.\n\nSpontaneous pneumothorax: Can present with chest pain and cough.\n\nMyocarditis: Can cause chest pain, but not typically associated with cough and blood in the sputum.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome: Can present with muscle weakness and loss of sensation.\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Can cause chest pain, but not typically associated with blood in the sputum.\n\nMyasthenia gravis: Can present with muscle weakness, but does not present with cough and blood in the sputum.\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Rare, but can cause chest pain and cough.\n\nMyasthenia gravis: Rare, but does not present with chest pain and cough with blood in the sputum.\n\nSarcoidosis: Rare, but can cause chest pain, cough, and blood in the sputum.\n\nPSVT: Can cause sudden onset chest pain.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is Pulmonary embolism.\n\n```Pulmonary embolism```\n\nLABEL:\nPulmonary embolism\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The initial response has a significant inconsistency in its reasoning. Firstly, it incorrectly states that the patient has been coughing up blood, which contradicts the evidence provided in the input indicating \"Have you been coughing up blood? - N.\" Similarly, the response states that the patient does not feel pain in other locations and that the pain is not radiating, yet the evidence indicates pain in multiple locations and mentions that the pain radiates to other locations. Moreover, the response repeats \"Myasthenia gravis\" in the analysis with inconsistent conclusions. These errors represent major contradictions and a lack of coherence in addressing the evidence provided, ultimately leading to an unsupported conclusion.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
