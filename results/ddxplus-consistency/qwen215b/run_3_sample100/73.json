Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 10\\nSex: F\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heavy\\n    - exhausting\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - back of head\\n    - back of the neck\\n    - side of the neck(R)\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel so tired that you are unable to do your usual activities or are you stuck in your bed all day long?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any lesions, redness or problems on your skin that you believe are related to the condition you are consulting for?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - pink\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - N\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - back of the neck\\n    - side of the neck(R)\\n    - side of the neck(L)\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - Y\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had a loss of appetite or do you get full more quickly then usually?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you immunosuppressed?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Influenza\\n- URTI\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Chagas\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Anemia\\n- Anaphylaxis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 10-year-old with significantly increased sweating, no pain, a back of the head pain, a side of the neck pain, a forehead pain, a back of the neck pain, a top of the head pain, the pain is 7 out of 10, no pain radiates, the pain is in the back of the head, the pain is 2 out of 10 intensity, the pain is not swollen, the rash is pink, the rash does not peel, the rash is swollen 4 out of 10, the affected region is the back of the neck, the pain is 2 out of 10, the lesion does not peel, the lesion is 4 out of 10 size, the itching is 1 out of 10 severity, the muscle pain is diffuse (widespread), the loss of appetite is not recent, the cough is not recent, the pain is not present while traveling, the pain is not present while not immunosuppressed.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nInfluenza: Symptoms match but less likely.\n\nURTI: Common in young children but not usually in a 10-year-old.\n\nHIV (initial infection): Rare in adults.\n\nBronchitis: Not common in children.\n\nPneumonia: Common in young children but not usually in a 10-year-old.\n\nChagas: Not common in children.\n\nScombroid food poisoning: Common in adults.\n\nTuberculosis: Common in adults but not usually in a 10-year-old.\n\nAnemia: Not common in a 10-year-old.\n\nAnaphylaxis: Not common in a 10-year-old.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is URTI.\n\n```URTI```\n\nLABEL:\nInfluenza\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE lacks consistency and contains significant gaps in reasoning. There are several errors and contradictions:\n\n1. The INITIAL RESPONSE starts by stating \"a 10-year-old with significantly increased sweating,\" yet the INPUT clearly indicates \"Have you had significantly increased sweating? - N.\" This inconsistency shows a misunderstanding of the INPUT.\n\n2. The INITIAL RESPONSE mentions \"the pain is 7 out of 10\" but later erroneously comments \"the pain is 2 out of 10 intensity.\" There is a misinterpretation or mishandling of data regarding pain intensity, as the INPUT indicates a consistent intensity of 7 for the headache pain.\n\n3. The response reports \"pain is not swollen\" and \"the pain is not present while traveling,\" which seem unnecessary or misaligned comments since the INPUT provides specific pain locations and intensities, not conditions of swelling or pain during travel.\n\n4. Critically, during option evaluation, the reasoning skips steps and employs inaccurate generalizations, such as suggesting HIV and Tuberculosis are only common in adults, ignoring the actual symptoms or details provided in the INPUT.\n\n5. Finally, the suggested diagnosis of URTI is given with a contradictory rationale, stating it is \"common in young children but not usually in a 10-year-old,\" making it incoherent with the decision.\n\nThis initial response is no longer methodical or highly logical due to these issues and unwarranted assumptions, resulting in incorrect diagnosis.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
