Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 87\\nSex: M\\nAre you currently taking or have you recently taken anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - heavy\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - ankle(L)\\n    - thigh(L)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(R)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(L)\\n    - sole(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have heart failure?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have liver cirrhosis?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had surgery to remove lymph nodes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have swelling in one or more areas of your body?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - ankle(R)\\n    - thigh(L)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(R)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(L)\\n    - sole(R)\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Localized edema\\n- Chagas\\n- Anaphylaxis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nAn 87-year-old male presenting with knee and thigh pain, which \"seems to come on suddenly.\" Pain is described as heavy, tedious, and sharp.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE has multiple logical inconsistencies and errors in reasoning:\n\n1. The initial response inaccurately states \"knee and thigh pain,\" whereas the input specifies pain in the ankle and foot areas, but not the knee. The localization of pain is misrepresented.\n2. The response mentions that \"the pain doesn't radiate\" but fails to adequately relate this to the provided evidence, merely repeating information rather than analyzing it.\n3. The options are analyzed in a shallow manner, making assumptions or conclusions without thorough justification. Specifically, the conclusion that Chagas is the most probable diagnosis seems unfounded, given that the symptoms do not align with Chagas, and the evidence presents localized pain and swelling which aligns more with localized edema.\n4. The response does not effectively counter the label by providing strong coherent reasoning for the alternative diagnosis selected.\n\nGiven these points, there is a clear lack of coherent reasoning and logical progression within the INITIAL RESPONSE. Therefore, it does not meet the criterion for consistency.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
