Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 41\\nSex: M\\nDo you have a poor diet?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a diagnosis of anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any family members who have been diagnosed with anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tugging\\n    - a cramp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - temple(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel lightheaded and dizzy or do you feel like you are about to faint?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had stools that were black (like coal)?\\n    - N\\nAre you taking any new oral anticoagulants ((NOACs)?\\n    - N\\nIs your skin much paler than usual?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed light red blood or blood clots in your stool?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Anemia\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Panic attack\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- PSVT\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Cluster headache'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 41-year-old male with a poor diet and no family history of anemia.

    "prediction": "The initial response contains several inconsistencies and logical gaps. Firstly, the statement \"A 41-year-old male with a poor diet and no family history of anemia\" is incorrect, as the input explicitly states that the individual does not have a poor diet and has no family members diagnosed with anemia. This is a clear deviation from the provided evidence.\n\nFurthermore, the conclusion drawn (\"The most probable diagnosis is Anemia\") contradicts the reasoning provided throughout the response. The initial response correctly notes that there are no symptoms or history of anemia based on the input data, yet it still concludes with anemia as the most probable diagnosis, which is logically inconsistent.\n\nAdditionally, the response includes assessments such as \"Not the typical presentation for anemic patients\" for conditions like panic attacks and Guillain-Barré syndrome, which already lack anemia relevance due to the person's negative history of anemia or related symptoms. These assessments are not pertinent to determining the diagnosis based on the given symptoms and input.\n\nGiven these considerations, the initial response does indeed skip crucial logical steps and makes unsupported assumptions, leading to a conclusion that contradicts its own analysis. Therefore, the response is not consistent.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
