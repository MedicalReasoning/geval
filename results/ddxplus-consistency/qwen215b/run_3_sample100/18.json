Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 48\\nSex: F\\nDo you have Rheumatoid Arthritis?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis (UC)?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had pneumonia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you immunosuppressed?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 48-year-old female presenting with symptoms of coughing up blood (negative for pneumonia, COPD, or other lung diseases), shortness of breath (negative for bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and bronchospasm/cough exacerbation), and anemia (negative for myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders).\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nBronchitis: May present with blood in sputum but usually due to inflammation.\n\nBronchiectasis: Involves atelectasis and hypoxemia.\n\nPneumonia: May cause cough and shortness of breath.\n\nPulmonary neoplasm: Can be diagnosed through imaging.\n\nAcute COPD exacerbation/infection: May present with shortness of breath.\n\nTuberculosis: Common in the upper respiratory tract.\n\nPulmonary embolism: Usually caused by a blood clot.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome: Rare.\n\nBronchospasm/acute asthma exacerbation: May be seen in asthmatics.\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Heart rhythm disorder.\n\nMyocarditis: Cardiac inflammation.\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Neurological.\n\nMyasthenia gravis: Muscle weakness.\n\nAnemia: Red blood cell problems.\n\nPSVT: Potential indication of a cardiac issue.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is **Tuberculosis**.\n\n```Tuberculosis```\n\nLABEL:\nBronchiectasis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "In the INITIAL RESPONSE, the reasoning appears to be inconsistent with the given INPUT. The response claims the presence of symptoms such as coughing up blood and shortness of breath, whereas the INPUT explicitly states negative responses, indicating the absence of these symptoms. The INITIAL RESPONSE discusses various potential diagnoses but fails to align with the detailed descriptions provided in the INPUT evidence. The conclusion of Tuberculosis is also contradictory, as the patient reportedly does not have a cough or travel history. The input specifies labels and conditions that do not correlate with the response’s conclusions. Consequently, this reasoning lacks coherence and consistency.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
