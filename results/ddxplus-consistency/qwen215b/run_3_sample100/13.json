Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 64\\nSex: M\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you had chills or shivers?\\n    - N\\nDo you have Parkinson’s disease?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had pneumonia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any lesions, redness or problems on your skin that you believe are related to the condition you are consulting for?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - pink\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - Y\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - back of the neck\\n    - lumbar spine\\n    - commissure(R)\\n    - commissure(L)\\n    - buttock(R)\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - N\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHave you recently had a loss of appetite or do you get full more quickly then usually?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed any new fatigue, generalized and vague discomfort, diffuse (widespread) muscle aches or a change in your general well-being related to your consultation today?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nIs your BMI less than 18.5, or are you underweight?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms more prominent at night?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pneumonia\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack\\n- Influenza\\n- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- URTI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 64-year-old male with coughing up blood and chest pain, characterizing as a knife stroke, feeling it on the right side.

    "prediction": "The initial response demonstrates several inconsistencies and logical gaps when compared to the input data.\n\n1. Inconsistency in symptoms: The input specifies that the patient did not experience coughing up blood, no fever, no rash, and no recent infections. However, the initial response states the patient is \"coughing up blood,\" \"no rash,\" and \"no fever,\" which contradicts the provided input information.\n\n2. Incorrect symptom description: The initial response adds unrelated symptoms such as \"eye redness\" and \"painful urination,\" which are not mentioned anywhere in the given input.\n\n3. Unsupported infection history: The response mentions a \"chlamydia infection 2 weeks ago,\" which is not present in the input data. This suggests that the response is making unsupported assumptions or pulling from irrelevant data.\n\n4. Diagnosis reasoning: The initial response concludes pneumonia as the most probable diagnosis based on a symptom (coughing up blood) that contradicts the input information. The reasoning process skips essential symptom analysis from the input, making the final diagnosis unreliable.\n\nOverall, the response fails to align with the input evidence and ignores key points, resulting in a lack of coherence and gaps in reasoning.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
