Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 17\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pericarditis\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- PSVT\\n- GERD\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Panic attack\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 17-year-old female with a pain characterized as a knife stroke in the breast (L side) with a sharpness, rated 4 out of 10 on a scale from 0 to 10. The pain does not radiate, is not precise, and does not appear suddenly. She feels no shortness of breath, is not experiencing palpitations, has not traveled recently, and the pain is not worse when lying down.

    "prediction": "The initial response discusses the various possible diagnoses by comparing them with the symptoms and patient characteristics. However, it contains logical inconsistencies and factual inaccuracies.\n\n1. The patient’s pain is noted in the input as radiating to the posterior chest wall on both sides, but the analysis states the pain does not radiate.\n\n2. There is a contradiction in saying that the pain \"does not appear suddenly\" and then suggesting \"Panic attack\" as a fit for \"sudden onset”.\n\n3. The analysis fails to address why symptoms don’t match the listed but incorrect condition of \"Pericarditis\" from the label. \n\n4. The alleviation of symptoms while sitting up is incorrectly stated since it actually is not a feature of \"Panic attack.\" \n\nThe reasoning does not fully support the selection of \"Panic attack\" as the diagnosis, while it completely ignores discussing \"Pericarditis\" which the label points to.\n\nFor these reasons, the initial response lacks consistency.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
