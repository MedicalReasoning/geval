Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 31\\nSex: F\\nHave you been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known heart defect?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating very irregularly or in a disorganized pattern?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America', 'options': '- Atrial fibrillation\\n- PSVT\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 31-year-old female who feels dizzy, lightheaded, and is not in the middle of any acute cardiac events, having never been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism or heart disease.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Occurs with rapid, irregular heartbeat.\n\nPSVT: Paramyocardial supraventricular tachycardia.\n\nAnemia: Low red blood cells.\n\nScombroid food poisoning: Common after eating raw or undercooked seafood.\n\nAn anemia would cause fatigue, not lightheadedness, but this does not match her symptoms.\n\nHypothyroidism is not a common cause of lightheadedness.\n\nHypertension is not a cause of lightheadedness.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is a normal clinical presentation with no other major concerns.\n\n```Normal clinical presentation```\n\nLABEL:\nAtrial fibrillation\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE is inconsistent in its reasoning and analysis. Here's why:\n\n1. The response incorrectly summarizes the evidence by saying the patient \"feels dizzy, lightheaded,\" but the evidence clearly states \"Do you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\" - No. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the input data, which then influences the analysis incorrectly.\n\n2. The response inaccurately connects presented options to symptoms that the patient does not exhibit. For instance:\n   - \"Hypothyroidism\" is mentioned, but the input question relates to hyperthyroidism and the respondent said \"No.\"\n   - The response mentions conditions like anemia and hypertension, which are not listed as options and does not accurately correlate the symptoms or test results.\n   \n3. The conclusion, \"The most probable diagnosis is a normal clinical presentation...\" ignores the given options and misinterprets the input data. The task is to choose from the options provided, and the conclusion does not address any option directly.\n\n4. There is also a lack of methodological step-by-step logical deduction based on the given input data versus the response, leading to an incomplete, confusing conclusion.\n\nTherefore, due to these inaccuracies and lack of logical alignment with the input, the evaluation would be: \n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
