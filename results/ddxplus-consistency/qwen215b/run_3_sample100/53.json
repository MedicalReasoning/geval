Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 37\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heartbreaking\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nAre you being treated for osteoporosis?\\n    - N\\nDo you have intense coughing fits?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased with movement?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- GERD\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Whooping cough\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Panic attack\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 37-year-old female with chest pain described as heartbreaking, sharp, and not radiating.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not adequately address the criterion of Consistency. The logical assessment contains significant inaccuracies and inconsistencies:\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of Evidence**: The initial response begins with incorrect interpretations of the given evidence. The evidence explicitly mentions severe pain rated as 10, but the response incorrectly mentions it as \"not severe.\" This is a factual inconsistency.\n\n2. **Analysis of Options**: The rationale provided for ruling out spontaneous rib fracture is not well-explained. The evidence presents multiple locations of pain that could be consistent with a spontaneous rib fracture. It is dismissed without substantial reasoning.\n\n3. **Logical Clarity**: The response lacks consistency in its logic, mentioning \"not sharp\" for several conditions while the evidence states the pain as \"sharp,\" suggesting a misunderstanding or misalignment of terms used between evidence and options analysis.\n\n4. **Conclusion of Bronchitis**: The diagnosis of bronchitis lacks alignment with the provided evidence. The given symptoms do not clearly point to bronchitis, especially given the absence of coughing, which is typically a key symptom.\n\nOverall, the response contains several logical and interpretational inconsistencies that fail to reason out correctly with the information at hand from the input. These gaps undermine the validity of the conclusions reached. Therefore, the evaluation based on the criterion would be:\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
