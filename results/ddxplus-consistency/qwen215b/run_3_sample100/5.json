Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 46\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\n    - iliac fossa(L)\\n    - testicle(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have any lesions, redness or problems on your skin that you believe are related to the condition you are consulting for?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - pale\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - N\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\n    - iliac fossa(L)\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - Y\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHave you been able to pass stools or gas since your symptoms increased?\\n    - N\\nDo you have intense coughing fits?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America\\nAre the symptoms or pain increased with coughing, with an effort like lifting a weight or from forcing a bowel movement?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Inguinal hernia\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Whooping cough\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 46-year-old female with pain in the iliac fossa, heavy and not radiating.

    "prediction": "1. The INITIAL RESPONSE begins with summarizing the patient's symptoms but does so inaccurately. It claims there is no rash or skin issues, whereas the evidence suggests a swollen, pale rash located in the iliac fossa region.\n  \n2. The analysis of the diagnostic options includes several inconsistencies:\n   - Inguinal hernia: Dismissed as usually not painful, despite evidence of iliac fossa pain and symptoms increasing with physical effort, which are indicative of hernias.\n   - Anaphylaxis: The response concludes this as the most probable diagnosis despite the absence of key anaphylaxis indicators such as acute allergic reaction signs.\n   - Scombroid food poisoning: Mistakenly described while ignoring the absence of nausea or diarrhea in the patient.\n   \n3. The chosen diagnosis, Anaphylaxis, is not consistent with the INPUT as it misses several critical symptoms such as an allergic trigger or acute progression.\n\n4. The logic contains significant gaps and errors, failing to consider aspects such as how a hernia could relate to iliac fossa pain. The diagnosis is not well-justified based on the evidence given.\n\nGiven these gaps and inaccuracies, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and logical consistency.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
