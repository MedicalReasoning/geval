Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 31\\nSex: M\\nDo you have an active cancer?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - scapula(R)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - scapula(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nHave you been unable to move or get up for more than 3 consecutive days within the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - nowhere\\nDid you lose consciousness?\\n    - N\\nHave you had surgery within the last month?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 31-year-old male with no history of cancer, no coughing up blood, no pain, and no movement or breathing issues.

    "prediction": "To evaluate the Initial Response based on the given criterion:\n\n1. The input evidence mentions multiple aspects of the patient's condition, including no cancer history, no coughing up blood, significant pain in various chest areas, but no shortness of breath, DVT, or recent immobility.\n2. The options present different possible diagnoses that correlate to the symptoms.\n3. The initial response systematically rules out each diagnosis based on the evidence but concludes with \"Myocarditis\" despite earlier stating \"Myocarditis: Not typically due to chest pain.\" This appears inconsistent as it had previously deemed myocarditis not aligned with chest pain.\n\nOn consistency evaluation:\n- The reasoning dismisses certain diagnoses without thorough justification for \"Myocarditis,\" conflicting with previous statements in the response, revealing a gap in logic. Additionally, myocarditis often presents with accompanying symptoms like fever or fatigue which were not considered in the analysis.\n- The response contains a repetition error listing conditions \"Myasthenia gravis,\" \"Anemia,\" and \"Sarcoidosis\" twice, indicating a lack of clarity in reasoning flow.\n- It concludes with \"Myocarditis,\" but the label provided is \"Pulmonary embolism,\" suggesting the ultimate diagnosis does not align with symptoms or evidence discussed.\n\nGiven these points, the Initial Response lacks coherence, presents contradictions, and does not thoroughly address the input.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
