Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 70\\nSex: M\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - pharynx\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 70-year-old male without a fever, cough, travel history, or symptoms of other known conditions (bronchitis, laryngitis, pneumonia, or chest pain). He has no tonsillar symptoms, pharyngeal pain, jaw pain, or a region of pain sensitive to touch. The pain is described as \"sensitive to touch,\" not \"burning.\" The pain is not localized to any specific part of the throat or jaw (no right or left tonsillar region), it appears quickly (not \"worsening over time\"), and intensity is not specified. Pain is not felt (no \"no fever\" or \"no cough\"). The patient does not have a travel history.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- Bronchitis: Not mentioned.\n- Acute laryngitis: Not related to sensitivity or sensitivity to touch.\n- Tuberculosis: Not mentioned.\n- Viral pharyngitis: Not mentioned.\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI: Not mentioned.\n- Unstable angina: Not mentioned.\n\nThe patient's symptoms suggest possible acute laryngitis, not likely to be bronchitis or laryngitis, and ruled out for acute laryngitis (not sensitive, not burning, not localized to throat, not identified tonsillar or pharyngeal involvement). The patient does not have a travel history and is not feverish. No cough. Acute laryngitis is a less likely diagnosis compared to other options. The patient's history fits more closely with a viral pharyngitis, which is less likely to be caused by an infection.\n\n```Viral pharyngitis```\n\nLABEL:\nViral pharyngitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE seems to contain several logical inconsistencies and misinterpretations of the INPUT data. Firstly, the response inaccurately states that the patient does not present with tonsillar symptoms, pharyngeal pain, or jaw pain, which contradicts the INPUT, where the patient explicitly reports pain in the tonsils, pharynx, and under the jaw. Moreover, the response mentions the absence of \"sensitive to touch\" or \"burning\" pain, overlooking that the INPUT characterizes the pain as sensitive and burning. Furthermore, the analysis seems vague and inconsistent in ruling out options without substantial explanations based on evidence from the INPUT. The conclusion that viral pharyngitis is the diagnosis lacks a clear logical pathway supported by the provided symptoms. The response should methodically address each symptom and align them with the possible conditions presented in the options. As such, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not demonstrate a coherent and logically structured argument based on the criteria outlined for Consistency.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
