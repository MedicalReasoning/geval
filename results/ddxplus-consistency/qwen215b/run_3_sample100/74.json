Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 51\\nSex: M\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you had chills or shivers?\\n    - N\\nDo you have Parkinson’s disease?\\n    - N\\nDo you have heart failure?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had pneumonia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any lesions, redness or problems on your skin that you believe are related to the condition you are consulting for?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - pink\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - Y\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - cervical spine\\n    - thoracic spine\\n    - lumbar spine\\n    - buttock(L)\\n    - shoulder(L)\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - N\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHave you recently had a loss of appetite or do you get full more quickly then usually?\\n    - N\\nHave you had surgery within the last month?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nIs your BMI less than 18.5, or are you underweight?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 51-year-old male without a history of chills, heart failure, pneumonia, COPD, or lesions on his skin.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provided in the task contains logical inconsistencies and errors. Let's evaluate the reasoning:\n\n1. The individual in question is a 51-year-old male without a history of certain conditions such as pneumonia or COPD. However, the response incorrectly states that the patient has symptoms of \"coughing up blood, rash, and painful urination,\" which are not present in the INPUT. The INPUT clearly states \"N\" for coughing up blood and does not mention any painful urination; instead, it specifies rash-related symptoms.\n\n2. The INITIAL RESPONSE suggests pneumonia as the most probable diagnosis based on incorrect symptoms, such as coughing up blood and fever, which the patient does not have according to the INPUT.\n\n3. The analysis of other potential conditions like bronchitis, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary neoplasm is based on incorrect symptoms attribution. For example, the discussion on tuberculosis mentions \"night sweats,\" which are not evident in the INPUT data.\n\n4. The mention of pleuropneumonia and sternal heart attack (STEMI) seems to be introduced without appropriate context to the available symptoms.\n\nDue to these discrepancies and reliance on misinformation, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and logical consistency. It fails to correctly interpret the patient's symptoms from the INPUT and creates a conclusion based on erroneous details.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
