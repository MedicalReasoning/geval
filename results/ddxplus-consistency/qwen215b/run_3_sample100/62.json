Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 39\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed any new fatigue, generalized and vague discomfort, diffuse (widespread) muscle aches or a change in your general well-being related to your consultation today?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pericarditis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Myocarditis\\n- GERD\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- PSVT\\n- Panic attack\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Chagas\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 39-year-old female with pain (a knife stroke) in the right breast (L), feeling it, not radiating, not precise, and not fast.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE attempts to evaluate various possible diagnoses for the given symptoms. However, it displays several inconsistencies and logical errors:\n\n1. The response incorrectly notes the location of the pain as the \"right breast (L)\" when the evidence states \"breast(L)\", indicating the left breast.\n2. It asserts that the pain was \"not precise, and not fast,\" which contradicts the evidence that indicates a precise score of 5 and a speed appearance score of 4.\n3. In analyzing the options, the response provides explanations which are at times incorrect or incomplete, such as associating PSVT with Long QT syndrome, which is a separate condition.\n4. The final diagnosis \"Panic attack\" is selected without sufficient justification or logical support based on the symptoms provided. \n\nThese errors and logical leaps in the assessment reflect a lack of coherence and methodical reasoning in reaching a conclusion. As a result, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not meet the criteria for consistency.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
