Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 45\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - mouth\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - nose\\n    - eye(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - back of head\\n    - nose\\n    - temple(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nHave you lost your sense of smell?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had pneumonia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have polyps in your nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a deviated nasal septum?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you more likely to develop common allergies than the general population?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 45-year-old female with sharp pain in her forehead, cheek(L), nose, eye(R), and a 3 on a scale of 1-10 for the intensity.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains significant gaps in reasoning and several inconsistencies:\n\n1. The response inaccurately summarizes the pain intensity as \"a 3 on a scale of 1-10,\" while the INPUT specifies an intensity of \"2,\" which shows a misunderstanding of the provided information.\n\n2. It states, \"The pain does not radiate...,\" yet the INPUT details the pain radiating to multiple areas: \"back of head, nose, temple(R), temple(L).\" This is a clear contradiction.\n\n3. The response incorrectly reduces URTI to \"Urinary tract infection,\" which is inconsistent since URTI typically refers to \"Upper Respiratory Tract Infection.\"\n\n4. The reasoning for choosing \"Viral pharyngitis\" is unclear and does not align with the evidence provided. Particularly, the rationale lacks consideration of pain localization, specific symptoms or links that might cause or indicate viral pharyngitis, such as a throat infection, which is not mentioned in the symptoms.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to maintain a coherent and accurate interpretation of the INPUT evidence and demonstrates critical gaps and inconsistencies that affect the conclusion. \n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
