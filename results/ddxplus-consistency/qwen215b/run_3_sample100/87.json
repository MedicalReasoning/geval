Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 77\\nSex: M\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - sensitive\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - temple(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Influenza\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 77-year-old male who does not live with four or more people.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE begins by summarizing the evidence from the INPUT and attempts to deduce a diagnosis from the given options. However, there are several issues in the reasoning:\n\n1. The symptoms described in the INPUT do not strongly align with URTI (Upper Respiratory Tract Infection), which typically includes symptoms like a sore throat, cough, nasal congestion, or runny nose. These symptoms are explicitly noted as absent in the INPUT.\n\n2. The response states \"His chest pain is not related to lung or respiratory diseases,\" but the INPUT does not mention any chest pain. This indicates either a misunderstanding or misreading of the evidence.\n\n3. The response dismisses several other options (\"not common\") without explaining why specific symptoms or the lack thereof rule them out. \n\n4. The reasoning lacks a detailed analysis or connection of how the described symptoms (or lack thereof) relate to each potential diagnosis.\n\nIn summary, the reasoning in the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks consistency and logical coherence. It doesn't thoroughly address all relevant aspects of the INPUT and makes an unsupported conclusion of \"URTI\" despite the evidence suggesting otherwise.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
