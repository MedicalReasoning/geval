Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 50\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\n    - sickening\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - hypochondrium(R)\\n    - hypochondrium(L)\\n    - belly\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - upper chest\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hiatal hernia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had stools that were black (like coal)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that get worse after eating?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N', 'options': '- GERD\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Anemia\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 50-year-old male with a burning sensation that starts in his stomach and goes up into his throat, with a bitter taste in the mouth.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE displays significant inconsistencies in its logical analysis. Firstly, it contains discrepancies in interpreting the INPUT. The INPUT explicitly states that the patient does not have a burning sensation that starts in the stomach and travels up the throat, whereas the INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly asserts that the patient does. This misrepresentation undermines the entire analysis since it is the basis for evaluating potential diagnoses. Additionally, the reasoning skips over relevant details such as the absence of pain after eating or while lying down, which could be pertinent factors in excluding or considering GERD, the correct diagnosis according to the LABEL. Moreover, the conclusion leapfrogs over more symptomatic matches in the differential diagnosis (such as reviewing GERD, which typically features heartburn and chest burning, despite denials in the evidence) and instead opts for Pericarditis without adequately justifying this choice over others that align more closely with the provided symptoms. There is an evident lack of systematic consideration of all pertinent symptoms and potential matches.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
