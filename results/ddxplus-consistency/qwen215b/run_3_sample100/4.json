Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 54\\nSex: M\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - occiput\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 54-year-old male with no recent contact with infected persons, living alone, no pain related to his reason for consulting, no pain in top of head, cheek(R), cheek(L), or occiput.

    "prediction": "1. The INITIAL RESPONSE starts by stating the patient's age, sex, living situation, and symptoms related to his complaint. However, there are some inconsistencies right from the beginning. The response inaccurately concludes that the patient lives alone while the provided evidence merely states that he doesnâ€™t live with 4 or more people, which does not necessarily mean he lives alone.\n\n2. Another point of inconsistency is the mention of no pain in specific areas like the top of the head, cheeks, or occiput whereas the INPUT clearly lists these as areas where the patient does feel pain. This indicates a gap in accurately interpreting the evidence. \n\n3. The summary of symptoms in the response inaccurately states that the patient has a clear runny nose when the INPUT explicitly states that the patient does not have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose.\n\n4. In reasoning, the response dismisses options such as a cluster headache and anemia based on presumptive symptoms or conditions not clearly substantiated by the evidence presented. This reveals shortcuts in reasoning and a lack of thorough analysis of the symptoms.\n\n5. Overall, the logical process is flawed due to the misinterpretation of evidence and incompleteness in analyzing each condition's applicability to the evidence.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
