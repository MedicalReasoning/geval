Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 52\\nSex: F\\nHave you ever had fluid in your lungs?\\n    - N\\nDo you currently undergo dialysis?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - ankle(L)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - upper chest\\n    - calf(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - biceps(R)\\n    - biceps(L)\\n    - jaw\\n    - scapula(R)\\n    - scapula(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have heart failure?\\n    - N\\nDo you have swelling in one or more areas of your body?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - ankle(R)\\n    - calf(R)\\n    - tibia(L)\\nHave you noticed any new fatigue, generalized and vague discomfort, diffuse (widespread) muscle aches or a change in your general well-being related to your consultation today?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that are increased with physical exertion but alleviated with rest?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Unstable angina\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack\\n- Stable angina\\n- Myocarditis\\n- SLE\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- GERD\\n- Chagas\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBased on the provided information, the patient doesn't have fluid in their lungs, they don't undergo dialysis, they don't have significantly increased sweating, and they don't have pain related to their reason for consulting (ankle or side of the chest).

    "prediction": "1. The INITIAL RESPONSE provided suggests Myocarditis as the diagnosis without considering all symptoms and details from the input. The logic is flawed because the response focuses on the absence of certain symptoms but doesn't fully address the presence of significant pain and its characteristics or the potential implications of such pain.\n\n2. The information provided in the INPUT reveals intense pain (level 8 out of 10), with specific affected areas, and pain radiating to multiple locations. These are critical clues that need to be methodically analyzed to arrive at a diagnosis. However, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not systematically evaluate possibilities like pulmonary issues or other cardiac conditions, such as Acute Pulmonary Edema which aligns more with the LABEL given, nor does it methodically rule out other conditions listed in the 'options' section.\n\n3. In summary, the INITIAL RESPONSE doesn't exhibit a clear, coherent reasoning process that addresses each symptom thoroughly, leading to gaps in the logical progression necessary to reach a diagnosis. This indicates a lack of consistency and methodological analysis as required by the criterion.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
