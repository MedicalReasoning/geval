Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 29\\nSex: M\\nHave any of your family members been diagnosed with cluster headaches?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - tugging\\n    - violent\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - eye(R)\\n    - eye(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel that your eyes produce excessive tears?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you take medication that dilates your blood vessels?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Cluster headache\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 29-year-old male with a history of cluster headaches.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provided has some inconsistencies and logical gaps in its reasoning:\n\n1. The response states, \"A 29-year-old male with a history of cluster headaches.\" However, the INPUT clearly states, \"Have any of your family members been diagnosed with cluster headaches? - N,\" which is a contradiction to the response's assertion of a history of cluster headaches. There is no indication from the INPUT that the individual themselves has a personal history of cluster headaches.\n\n2. The response mentions anemia as an option, with the note that \"None of the options mention anemia.\" This is contradictory because the options provided include anemia as an option.\n\n3. The consideration of Chagas is dismissed due to rarity, but no exploration of symptoms or logical analysis is presented to support why it can be ruled out based on the provided symptoms.\n\n4. Although the conclusion of cluster headaches may fit the symptom profile according to intensity and pain location, the response lacks detailed analysis or reasoning from the symptoms provided in the INPUT. It doesn't effectively tie these to the condition of cluster headaches, instead relying on a superficial and inconsistent shortcut by the initial incorrect assumption about history.\n\nTherefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, given the contradictions and lack of thorough analysis of the symptoms in relation to the conditions provided.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
