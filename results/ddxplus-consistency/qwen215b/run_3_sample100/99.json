Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 66\\nSex: M\\nDo you feel anxious?\\n    - N\\nDo any members of your immediate family have a psychiatric illness?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a cramp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\n    - hypochondrium(L)\\n    - breast(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with depression?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from chronic anxiety?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel lightheaded and dizzy or do you feel like you are about to faint?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had numbness, loss of sensation or tingling, in both arms and legs and around your mouth?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Panic attack\\n- PSVT\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Stable angina\\n- Anemia\\n- GERD\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Inguinal hernia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- SLE\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 66-year-old male reports feeling anxious, with a cramp-like pain in the right side of the chest. He does not have any immediate family members with psychiatric illnesses. Pain is described as a \"cramp,\" not a typical anatomic site, and the intensity is rated at 3. Pain does not radiate. The location is described as the side of the chest, not the iliac fossa or hypochondrium, which are more typical sites of thoracic pain. There is no history of shortness of breath. He denies a history of depression or chronic anxiety, but mentions feeling lightheaded and dizzy. He does not have numbness or tingling in the arms and legs. No recent travel history. He denies a history of asthma or bronchodilator use, and there is no history of anemia, pericarditis, or unstable angina. No recent experience with chest pain or dizziness, and no history of unstable angina. The anterior wall of the inferior myocardial infarction (STEMI) criteria are not met. The radiographic features of pulmonary embolism are not present. The patient has no history of sarcoidosis, pan- or chagasic disease, or Guillain-Barré syndrome. He does not have a history of GERD, atrial fibrillation, inguinal hernia, or boerhaave's reaction. The patient has not traveled internationally in the last four weeks.

The patient is stated as not feeling anxious in the INPUT, but the response inaccurately mentions the patient feeling anxious.\n2. The analysis includes incorrect symptoms like lightheadedness and dizziness, which contradicts the INPUT that specifies \"N\" for these symptoms.\n3. The response inaccurately describes the pain's location by mentioning it only in the \"right side of the chest,\" whereas the INPUT lists multiple pain sites including \"side of the chest(R),\" \"iliac fossa(R),\" \"hypochondrium(L),\" and \"breast(L).\"\n4.
