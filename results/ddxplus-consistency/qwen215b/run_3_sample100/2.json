Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nConsistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?\nThe initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 43\\nSex: F\\nHave you ever had a diagnosis of anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any family members who have been diagnosed with anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tugging\\n    - a cramp\\n    - exhausting\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - back of head\\n    - forehead\\n    - temple(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nDo you have chronic kidney failure?\\n    - N\\nDo you have very abundant or very long menstruation periods?\\n    - N\\nAre you taking any new oral anticoagulants ((NOACs)?\\n    - N\\nDo you think you are pregnant or are you currently pregnant?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed light red blood or blood clots in your stool?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nIs your BMI less than 18.5, or are you underweight?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Anemia\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myocarditis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 43-year-old female with lack of family history for anemia, no pain at the moment, and no significant location or intensity of the pain.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE is lacking in coherence and logical consistency, as it contains several significant gaps and errors in reasoning:\n\n1. **Patient's Pain Description**: The response claims \"no pain at the moment,\" which directly contradicts the INPUT where the patient reports pain in the \"back of head,\" \"forehead,\" and \"temple(R).\" The pain is characterized and has a non-zero intensity, which is entirely overlooked.\n\n2. **Dismissal of Potential Diagnoses**: The options related to pain, such as \"Cluster headache\" and \"Acute dystonic reactions,\" are dismissed with vague reasoning, despite the patient's reported symptoms aligning more closely with these conditions. For example, cluster headaches are indeed severe and often unilateral, but some characteristics and severity levels reported might imply it warrants further consideration than anemia, which is wrongly positioned as having no pain symptoms when, in fact, headaches can be associated with anemia.\n\n3. **Diagnosis Conclusion**: The conclusion jumps to anemia, which the initial reasoning does not adequately support. There is no indication of anemia-related symptoms such as fatigue or pallor mentioned in the information of the patient.\n\nThe response fails to maintain a coherent and logical flow. The conclusion does not logically emerge from the given data and reasoning. Thus, due to these significant inconsistencies and misinterpretations within the response, it cannot be seen as consistent.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
