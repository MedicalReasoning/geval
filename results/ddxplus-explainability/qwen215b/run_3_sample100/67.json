Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 80\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Influenza\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Boerhaave\\n- GERD\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Chagas\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think through this step-by-step. \n\n- The patient is a 80-year-old woman with pain on the side of the chest (R) and feeling of burning.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provides an analysis of the symptoms presented in the INPUT. It systematically addresses each symptom and relevant background information, such as pain location, intensity, smoking status, fever presence, and more. However, the conclusion (\"No specific diagnosis\") lacks clarity and justification, especially when the task requires labeling it as 'Bronchitis'. The reasoning process steps through the data but fails to connect these logically to the possible diagnoses provided in the options or explain why 'Bronchitis' is not a likely diagnosis. This makes the response lack the necessary clarity and conclusiveness expected by medical experts. Although the reasoning is articulated, it does not persuasively justify the conclusion, leaving a gap in understanding why Bronchitis or any other options were not selected based on the evidence.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
