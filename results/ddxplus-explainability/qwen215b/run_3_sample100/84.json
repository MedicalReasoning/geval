Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 49\\nSex: M\\nHave you started or taken any antipsychotic medication within the last 7 days?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever felt like you were suffocating for a very short time associated with inability to breathe or speak?\\n    - N\\nHave you been treated in hospital recently for nausea, agitation, intoxication or aggressive behavior and received medication via an intravenous or intramuscular route?\\n    - N\\nDo you have trouble keeping your tongue in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hard time opening/raising one or both eyelids?\\n    - N\\nDo you have annoying muscle spasms in your face, neck or any other part of your body?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 49-year-old male without any symptoms or treatment history, indicating either no exposure to antipsychotic medications or a different diagnosis, consistent with a diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis.\n\n```Myasthenia gravis```\n\nLABEL:\nAcute dystonic reactions\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "Upon reviewing the INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE, the goal is to evaluate the response based on its explainability to medical experts.\n\nThe INITIAL RESPONSE indicates that the 49-year-old male's symptoms or lack thereof suggest Myasthenia Gravis due to no exposure to antipsychotic medications. However, it jumps to this conclusion without a clear, logical connection. The response lacks thorough justification and detailed explanation on why the absence of symptoms and treatments specifically aligns with Myasthenia Gravis over other options. The reasoning should explore both provided options, \"Acute dystonic reactions\" and \"Myasthenia gravis,\" in relation to available evidence to guide the decision with clarity suited for medical experts.\n\nThus, the response is not adequately clear or informative, failing to provide a transparent rationale or explore all possible conclusions.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
