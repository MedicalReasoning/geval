Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 17\\nSex: M\\nDo you have swollen or painful lymph nodes?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a sexually transmitted infection?\\n    - N\\nHave you had diarrhea or an increase in stool frequency?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - a pulse\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - back of the neck\\n    - forehead\\n    - temple(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you feel so tired that you are unable to do your usual activities or are you stuck in your bed all day long?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you had unprotected sex with more than one partner in the last 6 months?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any lesions, redness or problems on your skin that you believe are related to the condition you are consulting for?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - pale\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - N\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - lower gum\\n    - labia majora(L)\\n    - internal cheek(R)\\n    - internal cheek(L)\\n    - bottom lip(R)\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - Y\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nHave you had an involuntary weight loss over the last 3 months?\\n    - N\\nHave you had sexual intercourse with an HIV-positive partner in the past 12 months?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Chagas\\n- Influenza\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 17-year-old male presenting with swollen lymph nodes, diarrhea, and pain in the temple.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately and thoroughly address the INPUT data and provide adequate explanations for the reasoning process. The response begins by inaccurately summarizing the symptoms, stating \"swollen lymph nodes, diarrhea,\" none of which are mentioned in the INPUT. Likewise, \"pain in the temple\" is improperly deduced without detailed context from the INPUT. The subsequent analysis of potential diagnoses misjudges the characteristics and context, such as inferring \"swollen lymph nodes\" without evidence.\n\nThe conclusion—favoring Sarcoidosis—is presented without a coherent basis rooted in the evidence given. A relevant, evidence-linked argument is lacking, leading to an incomplete, speculative result rather than a well-structured, logically evident diagnostic pathway suitable for medical experts. Consequently, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not sufficiently elucidate complexity or justify its standpoints.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
