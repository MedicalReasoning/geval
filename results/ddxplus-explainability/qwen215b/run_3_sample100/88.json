Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 21\\nSex: M\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- PSVT\\n- Anemia\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 21-year-old male with no known heart valve issues, COPD, shortness of breath, diabetes, significant overweight, slight dizziness, and no heart attack history.

    "prediction": "The initial response presents an evaluation of the given symptoms and options, but there are several issues in its explanation. \n\nFirstly, some statements are confusing and lack sufficient justification for dismissing potential diagnoses. For instance, it inappropriately relates anemia to COPD when the patient doesn't have COPD. Furthermore, it incorrectly connects panic attack likelihood with recent travel, which isn't a relevant factor for a panic attack diagnosis.\n\nAdditionally, the determination of the most likely condition is conclusively stated as a \"Panic attack\" without a clear connection to the patient's symptoms, given the absence of typical panic attack symptoms like anxiety or heightened stress. The references to each condition's likelihood or symptoms aren't always applicable or adequately linked to the specific case presented, reducing the clarity and persuasiveness for a medical expert audience.\n\nOverall, the response lacks a well-structured rationale and adequate explanation, causing difficulties for medical experts relying on this information to track the logical process used to reach the conclusion. Therefore, the response falls short of demonstrate exceptional clarity and precision required by the criterion.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
