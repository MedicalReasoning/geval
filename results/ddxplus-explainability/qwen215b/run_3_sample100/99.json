Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 66\\nSex: M\\nDo you feel anxious?\\n    - N\\nDo any members of your immediate family have a psychiatric illness?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a cramp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\n    - hypochondrium(L)\\n    - breast(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with depression?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from chronic anxiety?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel lightheaded and dizzy or do you feel like you are about to faint?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had numbness, loss of sensation or tingling, in both arms and legs and around your mouth?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Panic attack\\n- PSVT\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Stable angina\\n- Anemia\\n- GERD\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Inguinal hernia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- SLE\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 66-year-old male reports feeling anxious, with a cramp-like pain in the right side of the chest. He does not have any immediate family members with psychiatric illnesses. Pain is described as a \"cramp,\" not a typical anatomic site, and the intensity is rated at 3. Pain does not radiate. The location is described as the side of the chest, not the iliac fossa or hypochondrium, which are more typical sites of thoracic pain. There is no history of shortness of breath. He denies a history of depression or chronic anxiety, but mentions feeling lightheaded and dizzy. He does not have numbness or tingling in the arms and legs. No recent travel history. He denies a history of asthma or bronchodilator use, and there is no history of anemia, pericarditis, or unstable angina. No recent experience with chest pain or dizziness, and no history of unstable angina. The anterior wall of the inferior myocardial infarction (STEMI) criteria are not met. The radiographic features of pulmonary embolism are not present. The patient has no history of sarcoidosis, pan- or chagasic disease, or Guillain-Barré syndrome. He does not have a history of GERD, atrial fibrillation, inguinal hernia, or boerhaave's reaction. The patient has not traveled internationally in the last four weeks. There is no evidence of anemia, anaphylaxis, or recent or recent travel.

    "prediction": "The initial response attempts to address the concerns provided in the input by evaluating the patient's symptoms and medical history. However, it contains several issues that impact its explainability:\n\n1. **Accuracy Concerns**: The response inaccurately states the patient reports \"feeling anxious,\" which contradicts the input where the patient explicitly denied feeling anxious. Additionally, the response suggests the pain is located on the right side of the chest as a focal point, but the input also specifies additional pain locations (right iliac fossa, left hypochondrium, and left breast), which are not adequately integrated into the reasoning.\n\n2. **Statement Contradictions and Omissions**: The claim that the anterior wall of the inferior myocardial infarction (STEMI) criteria are not met is not clearly justified with specific input evidence. Furthermore, conditions such as unstable angina and international travel-related issues are dismissed without a coherent explanation or context from the input. This lack of systematic elimination of probabilities is critical for the intended expert audience.\n\n3. **Conclusion Mismatch**: The response concludes with \"unstable angina,\" yet fails to tie this to the initial evidence in a logical manner. The provided label is \"Panic attack,\" which is not justified or mentioned in the explanation provided.\n\n4. **Confusing Logic**: The overall logic of the response appears fragmented, juggling between symptoms and conditions without coherent correlation, making it difficult to follow the train of thought. Particularly, there are repeated and inconsistent mentions that do not match input details, such as historical declarations of unrelated conditions.\n\n5. **Language Clarity**: The response uses technical medical terminology such as \"anterior wall of the inferior myocardial infarction\" without adequate context, potentially losing comprehensiveness among some medical experts who might look for evidence-based support for these claims.\n\nConsidering these factors, the initial response lacks clarity, precise justification, and an alignment with the provided input. This makes it challenging for medical experts to extract useful, trustworthy information from the response.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
