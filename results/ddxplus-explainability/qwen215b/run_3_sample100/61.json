Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 35\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - side of the neck(R)\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - trachea\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high blood pressure or do you take medications to treat high blood pressure?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that the tone of your voice has become deeper, softer or hoarse?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Epiglottitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Larygospasm\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Unstable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 35-year-old female with throat pain (knife-like, sharp), pain localized to the tonsils, difficulty breathing, and no shortness of breath.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE is not clear, informative, or persuasive for medical experts. The presence of contradictions and inaccuracies significantly undermines the explainability. The initial response mentions that epiglottitis is \"not a symptom of the patient's symptoms,\" which is erroneous since epiglottitis can indeed present with sharp throat pain. The response also indicates that \"pulmonary embolism\" is the most probable diagnosis, yet this condition is mainly associated with shortness of breath, which the patient does not have. Additionally, the claim \"acute laryngitis: common but not throat pain\" is incorrect, as acute laryngitis can present with throat pain. The justifications lack detail, particularly for dismissing options, and some logical steps are missing. Therefore, this response lacks in provide well-articulated, sound reasoning justified with the patient data, thus failing the clarity that medical experts would expect. \n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
