Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 38\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - exhausting\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - biceps(R)\\n    - biceps(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - thoracic spine\\n    - shoulder(R)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you constantly feel fatigued or do you have non-restful sleep?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you exercise regularly, 4 times per week or more?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that are increased with physical exertion but alleviated with rest?\\n    - N\\nDo you have close family members who had a cardiovascular disease problem before the age of 50?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Panic attack\\n- Anemia\\n- GERD\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- SLE\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Chagas\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- PSVT\\n- Pulmonary embolism'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 38-year-old female with a characterizing chest pain of tiredness and exhaustion in the left side of the chest, with a painless discomfort localized to the left side of the chest with a dull ache and a 5 on a scale of 1-10.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE makes several inaccuracies when interpreting the INPUT and drawing conclusions from the provided evidence. Here are the observed issues:\n\n1. **Incorrect Interpretation**: The INITIAL RESPONSE mentions \"painless discomfort\" and \"dull ache\" while the INPUT clearly states the pain is characterized as \"tedious\" and \"exhausting\" with an intensity of 5 out of 10. The Initial Response incorrectly states that the pain \"does not radiate anywhere\", whereas the INPUT indicates it radiates to multiple locations.\n\n2. **Misleading Reasoning**: The reasoning given does not explain why the symptomatology specifically suggests unstable angina. It makes arbitrary assertions like \"The pain appears quickly\" and \"The patient does not smoke or have any cardiovascular diseases in the family\" without correlating them to the typical presentations of unstable angina.\n\n3. **Lack of Other Differential Diagnoses**: There is no discussion of alternative diagnoses despite their presence as options. The INITIAL RESPONSE fails to evaluate or even acknowledge the other differential diagnoses listed in the INPUT options.\n\n4. **Logical Flaws**: The conclusion that unstable angina is the \"most accurate diagnosis\" is not well-supported, considering the lack of specific symptoms related to angina and the absence of coronary artery disease risk factors mentioned (e.g., smoking, family history of cardiovascular disease).\n\nGiven these points, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not provide clear, informative, or persuasive explanations that would be suitable for a medical expert audience. The reasoning is insufficiently justified and lacks logical coherence with the input data. Therefore, the explainability of the INITIAL RESPONSE is inadequate.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
