Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 2\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - occiput\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Influenza\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 2-year-old female presenting with fever, headache, and a sore throat.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE lists a differential diagnosis for a 2-year-old female based on the provided symptoms. However, the initial explanation contains inaccuracies and lacks comprehensive reasoning, which diminishes the clarity and explainability of the response. \n\n1. **Inaccuracies**: The response mentions a fever and sore throat, neither of which are present in the INPUT. Despite these incorrect assumptions, the response attempts to justify the conditions, such as influenza being tied to a specific season, which is not relevant. \n\n2. **Justifications**: While some conditions are appropriately matched with common symptoms or excluded based on age (e.g., Chagas and Bronchitis), the rationale for the final diagnosis (URTI) lacks thorough justification considering the actual symptoms provided (various localized head pains) which align more with sinus-related issues rather than a URTI.\n\n3. **Reasoning and Structure**: The approach of reasoning \"step-by-step\" is a commendable structure for medical experts, but the content within these steps is not aligned with the given details of evidence.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The initial conclusion made is questionable due to incorrect premises (related to symptom recognition) and insufficient linkage between provided evidence and the deducted condition, which erodes credibility and clarity for medical professionals studying the case.\n\nDue to these inadequacies, the INITIAL RESPONSE is rated as lacking sufficient explainability for medical experts, leading to difficulty in trusting the presented diagnosis.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
