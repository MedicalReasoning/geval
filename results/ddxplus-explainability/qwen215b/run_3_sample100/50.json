Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 16\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain that improves when you lean forward?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - side of the neck(R)\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you regularly take stimulant drugs?\\n    - N\\nDo you have difficulty swallowing, or have a feeling of discomfort/blockage when swallowing?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that you produce more saliva than usual?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America\\nHave you noticed that the tone of your voice has become deeper, softer or hoarse?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Epiglottitis\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Larygospasm\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Chagas\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Viral pharyngitis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nAn 16-year-old male with pain that improves with leaning forward, related to his reason for consulting, and pain in the tonsil, side of the neck, pharynx, under the jaw, and tonsil. Pain is a knife stroke intensity, does not radiate, located 5 out of 10, and appears 3 out of 10. He does not take stimulant drugs, feels comfortable swallowing, experiences shortness of breath, has diabetes, rarely produces saliva, breathes through a high-pitched sound, has not traveled outside the U.S., and has a hoarse tone of voice.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nEpiglottitis: Pain improves with leaning forward, associated with throat pain and difficulty swallowing.\n\nMyasthenia gravis: Pain described, but typically affects the face and leads to difficulty swallowing.\n\nAcute laryngitis: Pain can improve with leaning forward, but not often.\n\nHIV (initial infection): Not typical symptoms.\n\nLarygospasm: Pain and associated breathing difficulties, but not leaning forward.\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Not typical symptoms.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome: Pain improves with leaning forward, but not often.\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Pain can improve with leaning forward, but not often.\n\nMyocarditis: Pain and difficulty breathing can be associated, but with no fever and no other symptoms.\n\nChagas: Not typical symptoms.\n\nPulmonary embolism: Not typical symptoms.\n\nScombroid food poisoning: Not typical symptoms.\n\nPSVT: Not typical symptoms.\n\nSLE: Not typical symptoms.\n\nAnaphylaxis: Pain improves with leaning forward, but not often.\n\nViral pharyngitis: Pain described, but often happens with fever and difficulty swallowing.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is Viral pharyngitis.\n\n```Viral pharyngitis```\n\nLABEL:\nEpiglottitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provided does not adequately explain the reasoning for its conclusion. Here are some specific points:\n\n1. There are inaccuracies in summarizing the patient's symptoms from the INPUT. For instance, the INITIAL RESPONSE states that the patient's pain improves when leaning forward, but the INPUT indicates otherwise.\n\n2. The analysis of potential diagnoses does not fully justify why certain options were considered \"not typical symptoms\" or why some conditions were dismissed. There is a lack of detailed explanation regarding why the \"most probable diagnosis is Viral pharyngitis,\" especially since the absence of typical symptoms like fever and difficulty swallowing was noted.\n\n3. The reasoning is inconsistent and lacks clarity. For example, \"Pain improves with leaning forward\" is mentioned multiple times for different diagnoses without clear justification for its relevance or removal from the differential diagnosis.\n\n4. The response fails to convincingly articulate why \"Epiglottitis\" is not the correct diagnosis, despite it being the labeled answer. The potential seriousness of epiglottitis is not discussed nor is there an attempt to analyze why a different conclusion was drawn.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks a logical and clear presentation of medical reasoning expected for an audience of medical experts. Therefore, the evaluation is:\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
