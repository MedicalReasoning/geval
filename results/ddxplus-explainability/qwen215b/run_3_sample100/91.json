Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 52\\nSex: F\\nHave you ever had fluid in your lungs?\\n    - N\\nDo you currently undergo dialysis?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - ankle(L)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - upper chest\\n    - calf(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - biceps(R)\\n    - biceps(L)\\n    - jaw\\n    - scapula(R)\\n    - scapula(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have heart failure?\\n    - N\\nDo you have swelling in one or more areas of your body?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - ankle(R)\\n    - calf(R)\\n    - tibia(L)\\nHave you noticed any new fatigue, generalized and vague discomfort, diffuse (widespread) muscle aches or a change in your general well-being related to your consultation today?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that are increased with physical exertion but alleviated with rest?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Unstable angina\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack\\n- Stable angina\\n- Myocarditis\\n- SLE\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- GERD\\n- Chagas\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBased on the provided information, the patient doesn't have fluid in their lungs, they don't undergo dialysis, they don't have significantly increased sweating, and they don't have pain related to their reason for consulting (ankle or side of the chest).

The patient description suggests multiple symptoms and conditions that could be cross-referenced with the diagnostic options, yet the response only briefly mentions a few negative findings to dismiss other conditions without a clear, step-by-step reasoning process. It does not engage with the symptoms or the options thoroughly enough to persuade or guide a medical expert audience through its diagnostic conclusion. This lack of detailed explanation and exploration of potential alternative diagnoses reflects a gap in clarity and explainability that would be required in a professional medical setting.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
