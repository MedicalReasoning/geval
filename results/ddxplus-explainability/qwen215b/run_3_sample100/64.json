Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 64\\nSex: M\\nDo you have metastatic cancer?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heartbreaking\\n    - haunting\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - violent\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - upper chest\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nAre you being treated for osteoporosis?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nDo you have intense coughing fits?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased with movement?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Whooping cough\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Boerhaave\\n- GERD\\n- Stable angina\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThis patient is 64 years old with metastatic cancer, no pain, and a pain characterized as a \"heartbreaking.\" He does not feel pain in specific locations like chest, side, or upper.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE presents a case evaluation for a 64-year-old male patient who does not have metastatic cancer and reports pain as \"heartbreaking\" among other descriptions, located in the chest area with an intensity of 6. The patientâ€™s pain does not increase with movement or deep breathing, and there are no factors like excessive alcohol use or recent travel to complicate the diagnosis. From the patient details and available options, the INITIAL RESPONSE concludes with the diagnosis of a \"spontaneous rib fracture.\"\n\nHowever, the INITIAL RESPONSE has critical inaccuracies:\n1. Errors in comprehension: The patient does not have metastatic cancer, yet the response incorrectly specifies otherwise.\n2. Confounding explanations: Asserting no specific pain when multiple chest locations are indeed indicated.\n3. Imprecise reasoning for the diagnosis: Does not elaborate on why 'Spontaneous rib fracture' is the only plausible diagnosis out of the given list.\n\nThese inaccuracies hinder the clarity, and the response lacks necessary context for its diagnosis, making it insufficient for a medical expert audience. It fails to connect the symptoms accurately to the selected diagnosis with a clear rationale, ultimately leading to a vague and unreliable conclusion.\n\n```PREDICTION``` No ```"
