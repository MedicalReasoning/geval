Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 10\\nSex: F\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDid your cheeks suddenly turn red?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any lesions, redness or problems on your skin that you believe are related to the condition you are consulting for?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - pink\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - N\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - biceps(R)\\n    - biceps(L)\\n    - mouth\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - ankle(R)\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - Y\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you feeling nauseous or do you feel like vomiting?\\n    - N\\nDid you eat dark-fleshed fish (such as tuna) or Swiss cheese before the reaction occurred?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 10-year-old with shortness of breath and difficulty breathing, and a red skin lesion.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE lacks explainability because it includes multiple inaccuracies and fails to provide a coherent analysis. The input clearly states that the patient is not experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, yet the response repeatedly mentions these symptoms in relation to the conditions considered in the differential diagnosis. Furthermore, the analysis claims that the most likely diagnosis is Scombroid food poisoning, despite the absence of a history of dark-fleshed fish consumption, which is specifically mentioned in the input. This indicates a failure to logically interpret critical pieces of information provided in the input. Additionally, the response overlooks the presence of symptoms such as severe itching and the large size of the lesion, which could be relevant in narrowing down the diagnosis. The explanation is confusing and does not align with the evidence, lacking justification or a step-by-step reasoning process that would make it understandable for medical experts.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
