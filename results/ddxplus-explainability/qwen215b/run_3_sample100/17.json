Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 59\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - occiput\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 59-year-old female with no history of cough, fever, or sore throat, no travel, no exposure to secondhand smoke, no contact with similar symptoms, and no sore throat or cough.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nBronchitis: Often associated with a cough, but here there is no cough.\n\nURTI: Usually non-specific symptoms, doesn't look like URTI.\n\nCluster headache: Not usually associated with other symptoms here.\n\nChagas: No previous history.\n\nAnemia: No history of anemia.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is URTI.\n\n```URTI```\n\nLABEL:\nURTI\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE of the provided medical case is not optimally clear and lacks a comprehensive explanation that's tailored to a medical expert audience. Here's why:\n\n1. **Patient Profile Clarification**: The response sometimes repeats unnecessary information, such as mentioning \"no sore throat\" twice, which does not add clarity. It could better focus on what's clinically relevant.\n\n2. **Analyzing Options**: While the response does analyze each potential diagnosis, some explanations are too simplistic for a medical expert audience. For instance, the statement \"URTI: Usually non-specific symptoms, doesn't look like URTI,\" lacks clarity since it does not justify why the symptoms do or do not appear consistent with an Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI).\n\n3. **Differential Diagnosis**:\n    - The conclusion of URTI is given without adequate support; the symptoms of tedious and heavy pain on different parts of the head are not typically indicative of URTI without other respiratory or systemic features.\n    - For Cluster Headaches, although it is stated that cluster headaches are \"not usually associated with other symptoms,\" it misses exploring how the headache characteristics could align or diverge with this diagnosis.\n  \n4. **Conclusion**: The response does not sufficiently explain why URTI was chosen as the diagnosis over other possibilities, such as elaborating why each differential is less compatible with the presented symptoms.\n\nThe arguments behind excluding or including each diagnosis need a more robust rationale. For the option selected, the explanation lacks a direct link between symptoms and how they specifically point to URTI among the given options.\n\nThus, based on the explanation criterion, the response lacks depth in its reasoning and fails to clearly justify the selected diagnosis. It doesn't fully convince a medical expert due to insufficient analysis and explanation.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
