Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 4\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Croup\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 4-year-old girl with pain on the side of the chest, characterized as burning. She does not feel the pain anywhere, does not radiate, and cannot specify how precise. Her pain occurred suddenly, with no fever or shortness of breath. She does not have a cough that produces more than usual sputum, and her cough did not result in a fever. She has not traveled out of the country or noticed wheezing sounds. She is not experiencing any other symptoms that are uncommon for her age (cough, fever, wheezing, difficulty breathing, coughing up blood, etc.). \n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nPneumonia: Common cause in children, but typically has sputum and fever.\n\nBronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation: Common cause in children, but cough is the typical symptom.\n\nBronchitis: Can cause chest pain, but usually has signs of infection, such as fever and sputum.\n\nTuberculosis: Can cause chest pain, but is more common in adults.\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Can cause chest pain, but is not uncommon in children.\n\nMyocarditis: Can cause chest pain, but is uncommon in children.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome: Can cause muscle weakness, but is not common in children.\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Rare, but can cause muscle spasms and chest pain.\n\nMyasthenia gravis: Can cause muscle weakness, but is uncommon in children.\n\nCroup: Can cause chest pain, but is uncommon in children.\n\nSarcoidosis: Can cause generalized symptoms, but is uncommon in children.\n\nChagas: Can cause generalized symptoms, but is uncommon in children.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is Pneumonia.\n\n```Pneumonia```\n\nLABEL:\nBronchitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE includes an analysis of each potential diagnosis based on the provided symptoms. The explanation outlines the absence of common symptoms such as fever and cough, which are typically associated with conditions like pneumonia, bronchospasm, and bronchitis, among others. The process of ruling out various diagnoses is clearly laid out, with justification provided for why some conditions are less likely given the patient's symptoms. The reasoning is systematically applied to each potential condition, and while the final prediction (pneumonia) does not match the label (bronchitis), the overall clarity and explanation of the steps taken to reach the conclusion is well-articulated and reasoned for medical experts. Therefore, while the prediction itself could be debated, the criteria for explainability, which focuses on clarity and reasoning, are met. \n\nPREDICTION: ```Yes```"
