Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 49\\nSex: M\\nHave any of your family members been diagnosed with cluster headaches?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - violent\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - eye(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel that your eyes produce excessive tears?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Cluster headache'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe patient presents with headache-like pain in the forehead, cheek (right and left), temple (left), and eye (right) with a 9/10 intensity, no radiating pain, located at a precise 8 (out of 10), and no excessive alcohol consumption or addiction.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nCluster headache: Fits the description with location of pain and intensity of 9/10.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is Cluster headache.\n\n```Cluster headache```\n\nLABEL:\nCluster headache\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE communicates the reasoning process quite clearly by identifying the key symptoms of the patient and systematically analyzing how they fit with the diagnosis of cluster headache. The response clearly states the symptoms such as pain in specific areas, intensity, and absence of radiating pain, and matches these with the typical presentation of cluster headaches. However, the justification for the diagnosis could be more detailed by including how the absence of family history and excessive alcohol consumption align with or against this diagnosis. Nevertheless, the step-by-step approach in confirming \"cluster headache\" is logically sound and relevant to the input, which adds to its clarity. The response is easily understandable and appropriately structured for a medical expert audience.\n\n```PREDICTION```Yes```"
