Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 41\\nSex: M\\nDo you have a poor diet?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a diagnosis of anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any family members who have been diagnosed with anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tugging\\n    - a cramp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - temple(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel lightheaded and dizzy or do you feel like you are about to faint?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had stools that were black (like coal)?\\n    - N\\nAre you taking any new oral anticoagulants ((NOACs)?\\n    - N\\nIs your skin much paler than usual?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed light red blood or blood clots in your stool?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Anemia\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Panic attack\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- PSVT\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Cluster headache'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 41-year-old male with a poor diet and no family history of anemia.

    "prediction": "1. The INITIAL RESPONSE reveals a basic understanding of the patient's profile and accurately restates some of the key pieces of information provided in the INPUT. It acknowledges the patient's mentioned symptoms and past medical history.\n\n2. However, the INITIAL RESPONSE contains inaccuracies, such as stating the patient has a poor diet when the INPUT clearly states the patient does not. This could lead to confusion among medical experts.\n\n3. The reasoning process lacks transparency, clarity, and medical precision. It fails to adequately explain why Anemia is considered the most probable diagnosis despite earlier rejecting it due to lack of symptoms or history. \n\n4. The refutation of conditions was not explained specifically with the combination of the patient's symptoms or lack thereof, leading to insufficient context for each conclusion.\n\n5. Therefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not communicate medical information in a highly explainable manner that meets the standards delineated for medical experts.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
