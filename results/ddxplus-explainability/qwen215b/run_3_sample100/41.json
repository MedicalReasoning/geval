Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 26\\nSex: M\\nIs your nose or the back of your throat itchy?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe itching in one or both eyes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live in in a big city?\\n    - N\\nAre you more likely to develop common allergies than the general population?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Allergic sinusitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Influenza'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe given information suggests a patient with no symptoms of common allergies, traveling less than 4 weeks, and living in a non-big city. This indicates a less likely case of Influenza (the common cold).\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAllergic sinusitis: Common in people with allergies and travel history.\n\nBronchitis: Common in smokers.\n\nURTI: Often includes cough, fever, and facial flushing, but not all.\n\nInfluenza: A common cold.\n\nBased on the given information, the most likely diagnosis is Bronchitis.\n\n```Bronchitis```\n\nLABEL:\nAllergic sinusitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does provide a logical progression of reasoning, listing and evaluating the options based on the given symptoms and evidence. However, it exhibits some significant shortcomings in explainability for a medical expert audience:\n\n1. Misinterpretation: The response misinterprets \"Influenza\" as \"the common cold,\" which are distinct entities, suggesting a lack of clarity in medical information.\n2. Vagueness: The explanation for rejecting options or concluding on \"Bronchitis\" is vague, particularly without the presence of relevant symptoms (e.g., cough).\n3. Lack of specificity: The reasoning lacks detailed medical insight and correlations between symptoms and conditions, besides making an inaccurate assertion about \"Bronchitis\" without supporting symptoms like cough or smoking status.\n4. Insufficient Justification: The conclusion lacks sufficient justification for the exclusion of conditions like \"Allergic sinusitis,\" which was incorrectly dismissed based on travel history instead of symptomatology.\n\nTherefore, the initial response fails to provide clear, informative, and persuasive communication for medical experts, as required by the criterion.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
