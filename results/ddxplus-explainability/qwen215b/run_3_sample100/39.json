Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 24\\nSex: F\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Larygospasm'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 24-year-old female with no history of asthma or bronchodilator use.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provides a step-by-step analysis of the patient's profile, such as age, sex, and medical history, which lacks certain symptoms or risk factors. However, the response presents a critical mismatch by incorrectly identifying Oropharyngeal dysphagia as the most probable diagnosis when the label and given option are \"Larygospasm,\" thus confusing the evaluation by providing an incorrect concluding diagnosis. This lacks significant clarity and fails to provide medical reasoning or justification connecting the evidence to the suggested erroneous diagnosis, leading to an inconsistent narrative. Therefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not meet the explainability criterion for medical experts.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
