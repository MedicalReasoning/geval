Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 45\\nSex: F\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - occiput\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Influenza\\n- URTI\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 45-year-old female not living with family or attending daycare.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE is problematic in terms of explainability. Although the analysis begins with a step-by-step approach, there are several inaccuracies and issues making it unclear and unpersuasive:\n\n1. **Incorrect Information**: The response claims that conditions like Pneumonia, Bronchitis, Influenza, URTI, Tuberculosis, etc., are not listed in the options, which is incorrect as these are indeed in the list of possible options.\n\n2. **Lack of Justification**: The response does not offer adequate justification for considering Influenza as the most likely diagnosis, especially since the patient lacks characteristic symptoms like fever, sore throat, or cough, which are commonly associated with Influenza.\n\n3. **Inaccurate Analysis**: It fails to address the absence of symptoms that are critical for diagnosing each condition, such as fever and cough for conditions like Influenza, Tuberculosis, and URTI.\n\n4. **Structure and Clarity**: The reasoning behind ruling out other conditions is not well structured or explained in a manner that aligns with the provided evidence.\n\n5. **Conclusion Mismatch**: The conclusion drawn (\"Influenza\") does not align with the inputs provided and the actual likelihood based on symptoms.\n\nAs a result of these issues, the INITIAL RESPONSE is not clear or informative for medical experts and lacks proper justification for its conclusions.\n\nPREDICTION: ```PREDICTION```No```"
