Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 31\\nSex: F\\nHave you been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known heart defect?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating very irregularly or in a disorganized pattern?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America', 'options': '- Atrial fibrillation\\n- PSVT\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 31-year-old female who feels dizzy, lightheaded, and is not in the middle of any acute cardiac events, having never been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism or heart disease.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Occurs with rapid, irregular heartbeat.\n\nPSVT: Paramyocardial supraventricular tachycardia.\n\nAnemia: Low red blood cells.\n\nScombroid food poisoning: Common after eating raw or undercooked seafood.\n\nAn anemia would cause fatigue, not lightheadedness, but this does not match her symptoms.\n\nHypothyroidism is not a common cause of lightheadedness.\n\nHypertension is not a cause of lightheadedness.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is a normal clinical presentation with no other major concerns.\n\n```Normal clinical presentation```\n\nLABEL:\nAtrial fibrillation\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not sufficiently fulfill the explainability criterion for several reasons:\n\n1. **Clarity and Information**: The response begins well by presenting step-by-step reasoning, but it quickly veers off course. The introductory sentence inaccurately summarizes the patient's condition based on the evidences provided. The input states the patient denied feeling dizzy or lightheaded, whereas the response suggests the opposite.\n\n2. **Misinterpretation**: The response inaccurately associates symptoms or conditions not present in the input (e.g., \"a 31-year-old female who feels dizzy, lightheaded\") and later, wrongly attributes fatigue instead of lightheadedness to anemia. It also mentions \"hypothyroidism,\" which is unrelated to the question at hand as the concern was with hyperthyroidism, which was ruled out.\n\n3. **Analysis and Conclusions**: The discussion of medical options is brief and lacks proper justification or contextual explanation. The definitions of conditions are generic and the response fails to tie these definitions to the evidence or the actual symptoms verified by the patient.\n\n4. **Irrelevant Information**: Hypertension and hypothyroidism are mentioned arbitrarily with no basis in the input, adding to the confusion rather than offering a relevant clinical insight.\n\n5. **Contradictory Conclusion**: The response references a “normal clinical presentation,” disregarding the label indicating \"Atrial fibrillation.\" There is no comprehensive evaluation or logical reasoning provided to rule out other conditions or meet the LABEL requirement.\n\nOverall, while structured, the response lacks precision and relevance to the given evidence and fails to articulate an informed conclusion comprehensively or persuasively for a medical expert audience.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
