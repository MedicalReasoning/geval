Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 50\\nSex: M\\nDo you feel anxious?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a cramp\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - flank(L)\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\n    - hypochondrium(R)\\n    - pubis\\n    - belly\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with depression?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from chronic anxiety?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel lightheaded and dizzy or do you feel like you are about to faint?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a migraine or is a member of your family known to have migraines?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are dying or were you afraid that you were about do die?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nAre you feeling nauseous or do you feel like vomiting?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had numbness, loss of sensation or tingling, in both arms and legs and around your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are detached from your own body or your surroundings?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a head trauma?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Panic attack\\n- PSVT\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Anemia\\n- Boerhaave\\n- GERD\\n- Inguinal hernia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 50-year-old man with significant anxiety, sweating, and pain in the right flank mentions the \"cramp\" pain.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE is not clear and contains inaccuracies. Firstly, it mentions \"significant anxiety, sweating, and pain in the right flank,\" but the INPUT data explicitly indicates no anxiety, no sweating, and pain in multiple locations with specific characteristics not restricted to the right flank. Additionally, it mentions numbness and tingling, which contradicts the INPUT, which states there is no numbness. These inaccuracies lead to a misleading analysis of the patient's condition.\n\nThe discussion of the medical options is not closely connected to the symptoms provided. The response incorrectly concludes an Inguinal hernia as the diagnosis without providing a logical explanation based on the symptoms given in the INPUT. The correct label was \"Panic attack\", but the response did not adequately explore this possibility and ruled it out without proper justification.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity, misinterprets the symptoms, and does not provide a persuasive or logical connection between the patient's symptoms and the proposed diagnosis. It fails to follow a logical reasoning process or offer sufficient justification for the diagnosis, thus not meeting the explainability criterion for a medical expert audience.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
