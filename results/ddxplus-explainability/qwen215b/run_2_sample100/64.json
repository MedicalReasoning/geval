Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 64\\nSex: M\\nDo you have metastatic cancer?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heartbreaking\\n    - haunting\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - violent\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - upper chest\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nAre you being treated for osteoporosis?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nDo you have intense coughing fits?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased with movement?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Whooping cough\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Boerhaave\\n- GERD\\n- Stable angina\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThis patient is 64 years old with metastatic cancer, no pain, and a pain characterized as a \"heartbreaking.\" He does not feel pain in specific locations like chest, side, or upper.

The patient does not drink alcohol excessively, is not being treated for osteoporosis, does not have an intense cough, has not traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks, and does not have pain that is increased with movement or breathing in a deep breath.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE inaccurately summarizes the INPUT and provides an incorrect diagnosis based on that summary. Specifically, it incorrectly states that the patient has \"metastatic cancer\" and feels \"no pain,\" which is inconsistent with the INPUT details. The INPUT clearly outlines specific pain areas and characteristics, and also specifies that the patient does not have metastatic cancer. Due to these discrepancies, the evaluation and rationale provided in the INITIAL RESPONSE are misleading and fail to convincingly justify the conclusion. As a result, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not exhibit the clear, informative, and persuasive qualities required for medical experts. \n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
