Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 25\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your vaccinations up to date?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms more prominent at night?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Allergic sinusitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- GERD\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- URTI\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Influenza\\n- Stable angina\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe patient is a 25-year-old male with a burning pain in the lower chest.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE offers a step-by-step analysis, attempting to evaluate various differential diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms, which include a 25-year-old male experiencing burning pain in the chest without respiratory symptoms like cough or wheezing, and without notable travel history. However, the response contains several inaccuracies and misinterpretations of symptoms and conditions:\n\n1. The response states the patient feels \"pain and difficulty in breathing when he exhales,\" which contradicts the INPUT where the patient does not report such breathing difficulties. This may mislead the analysis.\n\n2. The explanation for differential diagnoses provided presents several errors or misleading implications:\n   - GERD is actually a plausible cause for burning chest pain (typically linked to heartburn).\n   - Conditions like spontaneous pneumothorax, unstable angina, and pericarditis can be related to chest pain more accurately but aren't clearly justified based on the provided symptoms.\n   - Some explanations wrongly classify the possibility of chest pain in conditions like bronchitis and pneumonia.\n\n3. Important details from the INPUT, such as symptom severity, pain precision, and onset speed, aren't integrated into the reasoning, leading to an oversight in considering bronchitis as a more plausible diagnosis given a potential mild inflammation without cough, especially lacking other strong chest pain indicators.\n\n4. The conclusion is presented with \"The most probable diagnosis is Unstable angina,\" but lacks clear justification in relation to the symptoms described and doesn't address why bronchitis was chosen as a label, which needs more exploration of mild symptoms.\n\nOverall, the response lacks clarity, full justification, and transparency for its conclusions, resulting in a less explainable output for medical experts.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
