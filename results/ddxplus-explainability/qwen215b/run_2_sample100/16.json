Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inaccuracies in recollecting the patient's information and symptoms, which makes it confusing for the intended medical expert audience. It inaccurately states that the patient has increased sweating, radiating pain, and a history of panic attacks, while the INPUT clearly indicates these symptoms are not present. Moreover, it incorrectly claims the patient has a history of HIV infection, which is also contrary to the evidence. These inaccuracies detract from the clarity and reliability of the analysis. The response also lacks a comprehensive explanation or justification for the conclusion it draws, which undermines its persuasiveness. Consequently, the response is deemed not to meet the criterion of clear and precise explanation suitable for medical experts.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
