Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 37\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heartbreaking\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nAre you being treated for osteoporosis?\\n    - N\\nDo you have intense coughing fits?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased with movement?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- GERD\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Whooping cough\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Panic attack\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 37-year-old female with chest pain described as heartbreaking, sharp, and not radiating.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate reasoning for its conclusion. It incorrectly describes the pain as \"not severe,\" contradicting the evidence provided which indicates a pain intensity of 10/10, suggesting severe pain. Additionally, the response dismisses potential diagnoses too simplistically and without proper justification, such as rejecting possible causes based on rarity rather than specific symptom alignment. It also wrongly selects \"Bronchitis\" as the most likely cause, although the symptoms do not align well with it. There is a lack of comprehensive analysis, and the reasoning is neither clear nor persuasive for the intended audience, failing to adequately consider or explain the reasoning for ruling out other conditions. Therefore, the response is not sufficiently explainable or informative for medical experts.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
