Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 26\\nSex: M\\nIs your nose or the back of your throat itchy?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe itching in one or both eyes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live in in a big city?\\n    - N\\nAre you more likely to develop common allergies than the general population?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Allergic sinusitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Influenza'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe given information suggests a patient with no symptoms of common allergies, traveling less than 4 weeks, and living in a non-big city. This indicates a less likely case of Influenza (the common cold).\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAllergic sinusitis: Common in people with allergies and travel history.\n\nBronchitis: Common in smokers.\n\nURTI: Often includes cough, fever, and facial flushing, but not all.\n\nInfluenza: A common cold.\n\nBased on the given information, the most likely diagnosis is Bronchitis.\n\n```Bronchitis```\n\nLABEL:\nAllergic sinusitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE fails to provide clear and informative reasoning. It incorrectly conflates Influenza with the common cold and provides erroneous statements about each condition. For instance, allergic sinusitis is not necessarily linked with travel history, and bronchitis is not solely common among smokers. Also, there is no logical connection between the lack of symptoms related to common allergies, lack of travel, and the living environment with the reasoning for bronchitis. The conclusion that the patient is more likely to have bronchitis is not persuasive or well-justified considering the symptoms given (or lack thereof). The explanations are vague and confusing, making it hard for a medical expert to trust or follow the reasoning. \n\nMoreover, the mention of \"traveling less than 4 weeks\" is incorrect according to the evidence, which says \"Have you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks? - N\", which means no travel in the last 4 weeks. This error reflects a lack of attention to the details provided.\n\nThus, the response lacks clarity, is overly simplistic, and fails to connect its claims to the evidence provided in a meaningful or medically sound way.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
