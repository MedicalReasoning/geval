Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 59\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - occiput\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 59-year-old female with no history of cough, fever, or sore throat, no travel, no exposure to secondhand smoke, no contact with similar symptoms, and no sore throat or cough.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nBronchitis: Often associated with a cough, but here there is no cough.\n\nURTI: Usually non-specific symptoms, doesn't look like URTI.\n\nCluster headache: Not usually associated with other symptoms here.\n\nChagas: No previous history.\n\nAnemia: No history of anemia.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is URTI.\n\n```URTI```\n\nLABEL:\nURTI\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE analyses the provided symptoms and considers the diagnostic options systematically. Here's an evaluation of the response:\n\n1. The response starts by summarizing the patient's key symptoms and history, which is a good practice to establish the context.\n\n2. It then evaluates each diagnostic option by considering their typical presentation:\n   - For \"Bronchitis,\" it appropriately notes the absence of cough, which reduces its likelihood.\n   - For \"URTI,\" it vaguely states \"Usually non-specific symptoms, doesn't look like URTI‚Äù without specific details. This lacks depth in explanation, considering URTI could match non-specific symptoms.\n   - \"Cluster headache\" is dismissed without explanation related to the provided symptoms.\n   - It merely states that there is \"No history\" for \"Chagas\" and \"Anemia,\" without really addressing why these are unlikely based on symptoms.\n\n3. Finally, the response concludes URTI is the most likely diagnosis, but the reasoning lacks depth, especially as URTI typically does involve some respiratory symptoms which are not present here.\n\nThe explanation lacks thorough justifications, especially when comparing symptoms against possible diagnoses. It is neither persuasive nor richly detailed, which may leave medical experts questioning the reasoning process.\n\nPREDICTION```No```"
