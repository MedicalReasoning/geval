Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 56\\nSex: F\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Larygospasm'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 56-year-old woman who has a high-pitched sound when breathing in and has not traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE aims to evaluate the most probable diagnosis from the given options based on the provided symptoms and evidence. However, there are several critical issues with the response:\n\n1. **Incorrect Summary**: The INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly summarizes the symptoms. The INPUT clearly states there is no high-pitched sound when breathing in, contrary to what the response assumes.\n\n2. **Medical Reasoning Flaws**: The response lists several conditions and describes their relationship with the symptom of a high-pitched sound when breathing in. However, it often states \"but not mentioned\" for many conditions without explaining how it arrived at the conclusion of Larygospasm beyond this contradiction.\n\n3. **Missing Context**: The INITIAL RESPONSE is supposed to answer based on the given information with a focus on 'Larygospasm.' It provides no explanation about why this condition is chosen among others nor does it present reasoning for discarding others succinctly.\n\n4. **Logical Soundness**: The INITIAL RESPONSE makes a misstep in its logical conclusion by assuming a symptom that the evidence explicitly states is absent. This leads to a faulty conclusion.\n\n5. **Incomplete Analysis**: Several conditions are brushed off without adequate analysis, leaving gaps for medical experts reading the response.\n\nThe lack of clarity and precision in handling the medical information and symptoms provided in the INPUT suggest the response is misleading, encourages error, and lacks rigorous, logical reasoning.\n\nBased on these assessments, the explainability of INITIAL RESPONSE is inadequate, resulting in a decision of:\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
