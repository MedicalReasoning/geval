Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 20\\nSex: M\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - back of the neck\\n    - side of the neck(L)\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - occiput\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you feel so tired that you are unable to do your usual activities or are you stuck in your bed all day long?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - NA\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - N\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - N\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you immunosuppressed?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Influenza\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Chagas\\n- URTI'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 20-year-old male with a high fever (measured or felt) and an itchy rash.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and accuracy in its evaluation. It begins with an inaccurate summary of the patient's symptoms, referencing a \"high fever (measured or felt)\" and \"itchy rash,\" neither of which align with the INPUT data. The patient does not have a fever or an itchy rash, according to the evidence provided. This fundamental error significantly undermines the credibility and reliability of the INITIAL RESPONSE.\n\nMoreover, the analysis of the condition options seems to lack nuanced consideration of provided symptoms, such as the intense and localized neck and head pain. Instead, it provides generalized associations with common conditions without linking them to the patient's specific symptom profile. The suggestion of URTI as the most probable diagnosis is not substantiated by a review of the evidence available, especially since the patient reports no cough or fatigue.\n\nThus, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to provide a clear, accurate, and well-founded explanation suitable for a medical expert audience, as required by the criterion.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
