Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 57\\nSex: F\\nHave you been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known heart defect?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating very irregularly or in a disorganized pattern?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that are increased with physical exertion but alleviated with rest?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Atrial fibrillation\\n- PSVT\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Panic attack\\n- Anemia\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 57-year-old female without known heart valve issues, COPD, or previous heart issues, who experienced shortness of breath and slight dizziness.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE improperly analyzes the patient's symptoms and eliminates options without clear justification or accurate understanding. The description of symptoms doesn't match the provided evidence: the patient explicitly denies experiencing shortness of breath or irregular heartbeats, contrary to what's stated in the initial response. Even if the initial response were accurately reflecting symptoms, the reasoning is fragmented and lacks coherence.\n\nSpecific inaccuracies and gaps in reasoning include:\n- Incorrect statement of symptoms: The initial response suggests shortness of breath and irregular heartbeat contrary to the INPUT which states \"no\" to both.\n- Misunderstanding of options: For instance, defining PSVT as \"Pectus Sternal Vibra Triae\" is erroneous, and descriptions for some conditions are vague or incorrect.\n- Lack of logical progression: The response doesn't follow a logical clinical reasoning process that medical experts would expect, and the final conclusion (panic attack) is not justified based on the evidences provided.\n\nOverall, the response lacks clarity, accuracy, and reasoning that would make it understandable or trustworthy to medical experts. \n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
