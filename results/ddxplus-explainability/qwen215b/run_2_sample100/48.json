Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 59\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - mouth\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - nose\\n    - eye(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - back of head\\n    - nose\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you lost your sense of smell?\\n    - N\\nHave you had a cold in the last 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have polyps in your nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you have greenish or yellowish nasal discharge?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your vaccinations up to date?\\n    - N\\nAre you more likely to develop common allergies than the general population?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 59-year-old female with mouth, cheek, nose, eye pain, fever, loss of smell, past history of polyps, asthma, green nasal discharge, and no recent travel.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAcute rhinosinusitis: Severe, possibly accompanied by fever.\n\nChronic rhinosinusitis: Usually non-severe.\n\nAcute laryngitis: Larynx pain, not nose.\n\nChagas: Rare in developed countries and not often associated with nasal symptoms.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is Acute rhinosinusitis.\n\n```Acute rhinosinusitis```\n\nLABEL:\nAcute rhinosinusitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE presents an analysis of the input evidence and discusses potential diagnoses. However, there are some inaccuracies and missing elements:\n\n1. Misrepresentation of Symptoms: The initial response incorrectly states that the patient has fever, loss of smell, history of polyps, asthma, and green nasal discharge, which contradicts the input evidence where all these symptoms were denied by the patient.\n\n2. Lack of Comprehensive Explanation: The response provides brief descriptions of potential conditions but does not thoroughly explain why one diagnosis is favored over another based on the patient's symptoms. For instance, it claims that Acute rhinosinusitis is most likely but doesn't sufficiently explain how the patient's specific symptoms (burning, sharp pain in the mouth, cheek, nose, and eye with radiating pain) align with this diagnosis.\n\n3. Logical Inconsistencies: The justification of dismissing Chronic rhinosinusitis due to it being \"usually non-severe\" lacks clarity, especially given the patient's reported pain intensity of 8 out of 10.\n\nOverall, the response fails to deliver its medical reasoning clearly and persuasively while also containing factual errors based on the given input. \n\nThus, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not meet the explainability criterion effectively for a medical expert audience.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
