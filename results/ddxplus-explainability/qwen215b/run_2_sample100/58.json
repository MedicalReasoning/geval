Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 19\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - occiput\\n    - temple(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- URTI\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 19-year-old female who has not been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks, and does not attend or work in a daycare.

    "prediction": "1. The initial response needs to be clear and informative, detailing the reasoning process transparently. The response attempts to compile the evidence and analyze different medical conditions one by one.\n  \n2. In the analysis, the interpretation of the symptoms is inaccurate in terms of relating them to the potential diagnoses. In particular, describing the pain as \"tedious and heavy\" is not characteristic of the conditions analyzed. Moreover, the conclusion that \"The most probable diagnosis is Bronchitis\" doesn't align with the patient's input symptoms, most notably lacking cough or fever which are more commonly associated with bronchitis than the other symptoms presented.\n\n3. The response does not provide adequate justification for the conclusion, making broad statements without explicit context from the symptoms. The arguably inconsistent analysis of the evidence, alongside lack of clarity in connecting dots between symptoms and diagnosis options, makes the response neither well-structured nor compelling.\n\n4. While the step-by-step thinking is a positive approach, its execution in this response lacks precision necessary for a medical expert's level of analysis, leaving gaps in logic and leading to an incorrect conclusion according to the label provided (URTI).\n\nGiven the above breakdown, the response fails to meet the criterion of being highly explainable and clear for a medical expert audience.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
