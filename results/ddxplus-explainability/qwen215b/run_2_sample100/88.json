Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 21\\nSex: M\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- PSVT\\n- Anemia\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 21-year-old male with no known heart valve issues, COPD, shortness of breath, diabetes, significant overweight, slight dizziness, and no heart attack history.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE evaluates the given medical options against the patient's symptoms and health status, attempting to rule out diagnoses that do not closely align. However, several issues reduce its explainability for a medical expert:\n\n1. The response dismisses PSVT as \"unrelated to the patient's symptoms\" without elaborating on why this is the case, especially given the lack of specific symptoms rather than explicit symptoms that could rule it out.\n   \n2. It incorrectly links anemia with COPD, whereas the patient does not present with COPD. Furthermore, no connection is discussed between anemia and the presented symptoms.\n\n3. Myocarditis is noted for typically causing palpitations, yet palpitations are indeed absent in this patient. This should instead support the ruling out of myocarditis, yet it's not clearly explained how this affects likelihood.\n\n4. It also dismisses Atrial fibrillation without explanation, though such a condition can be asymptomatic or could fit potentially uncertain symptoms such as palpitations or racing heart.\n\n5. The reasoning against Myasthenia gravis is incorrect because it states the patient is not experiencing shortness of breath, which is acknowledged in the input.\n\n7. The elimination of Panic attacks due to lack of travel doesn't clearly correlate being affected only by recent travel.\n\n8. The conclusion of Panic attack is returned as a response doesn't categorize into a symptom analysis as an evidence-proof diagnosis, just an assumption note instead.\n\nThese inadequacies indicate a significant absence of structured rationale, creating vagueness rather than clear inference. It fails to provide adequate explanations which can be considered valid or trustworthy by a medical expert audience, especially when ignoring provided symptoms or corresponding conditions.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
