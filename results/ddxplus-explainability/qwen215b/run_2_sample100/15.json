Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 70\\nSex: M\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - pharynx\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 70-year-old male without a fever, cough, travel history, or symptoms of other known conditions (bronchitis, laryngitis, pneumonia, or chest pain). He has no tonsillar symptoms, pharyngeal pain, jaw pain, or a region of pain sensitive to touch. The pain is described as \"sensitive to touch,\" not \"burning.\" The pain is not localized to any specific part of the throat or jaw (no right or left tonsillar region), it appears quickly (not \"worsening over time\"), and intensity is not specified. Pain is not felt (no \"no fever\" or \"no cough\"). The patient does not have a travel history.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- Bronchitis: Not mentioned.\n- Acute laryngitis: Not related to sensitivity or sensitivity to touch.\n- Tuberculosis: Not mentioned.\n- Viral pharyngitis: Not mentioned.\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI: Not mentioned.\n- Unstable angina: Not mentioned.\n\nThe patient's symptoms suggest possible acute laryngitis, not likely to be bronchitis or laryngitis, and ruled out for acute laryngitis (not sensitive, not burning, not localized to throat, not identified tonsillar or pharyngeal involvement). The patient does not have a travel history and is not feverish. No cough. Acute laryngitis is a less likely diagnosis compared to other options. The patient's history fits more closely with a viral pharyngitis, which is less likely to be caused by an infection.\n\n```Viral pharyngitis```\n\nLABEL:\nViral pharyngitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE is somewhat unclear and contains inaccuracies and contradictions, which make it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented. First, there are errors in the reading and analysis of the INPUT data. The person does have \"burning\" pain as per the INPUT, yet the INITIAL RESPONSE mistakenly states that the pain is described as \"sensitive to touch,\" not \"burning.\" The INITIAL RESPONSE also fails to correctly process the fact that the pain is located in several specific regions: \"tonsil(R), tonsil(L), pharynx, under the jaw.\" Moreover, contradictory statements appear where acute laryngitis is both considered a possibility and then seemingly ruled out without clear reasoning. Additionally, the FINAL RESPONSE suggests \"viral pharyngitis\" without well-structured justification or compelling explanation as to why this is more likely than the other conditions listed. Discrepancies within the analysis indicate a lack of clarity and precision necessary for medical experts to confidently understand the conclusions drawn.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
