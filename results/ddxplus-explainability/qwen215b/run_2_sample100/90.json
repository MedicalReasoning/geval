Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 29\\nSex: M\\nHave any of your family members been diagnosed with cluster headaches?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - tugging\\n    - violent\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - eye(R)\\n    - eye(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel that your eyes produce excessive tears?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you take medication that dilates your blood vessels?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Cluster headache\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 29-year-old male with a history of cluster headaches.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE attempts to analyze the provided evidence in relation to the options (Cluster headache, Chagas, Anemia) but does not adequately convey the comprehensive reasoning expected for a medical expert audience. It inaccurately refers to a \"history of cluster headaches\" for the patient, which contradicts the input data (no family members diagnosed with cluster headaches, and no direct mention of personal history). The reasoning lacks transparency and does not provide sufficient justification for excluding other diagnoses or detail why cluster headache is favored besides age and gender. Additionally, the claim regarding anemia not being mentioned seems incomplete, as the evidence does not directly relate to anemia symptoms, but this is poorly explained. Overall, the response lacks clarity and depth, making it difficult for medical experts to trust or follow the conclusions presented.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
