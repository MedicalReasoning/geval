Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 61\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - upper chest\\n    - pharynx\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- GERD\\n- Influenza\\n- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe patient is 61 years old and reports pain on the side of the chest, upper chest, and pharynx.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provides an analysis of the patient's symptoms and evaluates each potential diagnosis based on the given symptoms. However, the reasoning lacks clarity and coherence in the following ways:\n\n1. The response lists many potential diagnoses without adequately explaining why each was considered. This makes it difficult to understand the reasoning process or how the final conclusion of Bronchitis was reached.\n2. The response mentions symptoms that could fit a variety of conditions (e.g., sensitivity and chest pain) but does not elaborate on why these symptoms most strongly suggest Bronchitis over other potential diagnoses.\n3. There are inconsistencies in the analysis, such as suggesting both that several conditions are ruled out and then listing many of them as \"initial diagnosis\" without sufficient justification for inclusion or exclusion.\n\nThe evaluation of the conditions is not comprehensive or well-articulated, and the reasoning is not sufficiently transparent or well-explained for medical experts to follow easily. The reasoning process needs to be more organized, with clearer connections between symptoms and likely diagnoses.\n\nTherefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks adequate explainability according to the criterion provided.\n\nPREDICTION```No```"
