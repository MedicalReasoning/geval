Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 27\\nSex: F\\nAre you infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - sickening\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - biceps(R)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - thoracic spine\\n    - shoulder(R)\\n    - shoulder(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high cholesterol or do you take medications to treat high cholesterol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high blood pressure or do you take medications to treat high blood pressure?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a problem with poor circulation?\\n    - N\\nAre you feeling nauseous or do you feel like vomiting?\\n    - N\\nAre you a former smoker?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have close family members who had a cardiovascular disease problem before the age of 50?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- GERD\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- Chagas\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Panic attack\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 27-year-old female who is not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus and reports no pain or shortness of breath.

    "prediction": "No, the initial response does not meet the criterion of explainability. \n\nThe response lacks clarity in its reasoning and fails to provide substantial justification for eliminating many conditions. For example, the statements about certain conditions being \"rare in this age group\" are presented without adequate explanation or supporting evidence, failing to convincingly narrow down the differential diagnosis. Additionally, inaccuracies such as stating \"GERD: Can cause chest pain but not in this age group\" overlook the fact that GERD can indeed cause chest pain in a 27-year-old. Furthermore, conditions like NSTEMI/STEMI, panic attacks, and even GERD are not ruled out with solid reasoning, which are actually possible considerations based on the INPUT. The conclusion that Sarcoidosis is the most likely diagnosis is made without a robust analysis, as the patient's reported symptoms are not typical for this condition. Therefore, the response overall does not provide a clear, transparent, and persuasive argument to medical experts.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
