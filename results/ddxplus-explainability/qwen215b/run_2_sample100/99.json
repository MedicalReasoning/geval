Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 66\\nSex: M\\nDo you feel anxious?\\n    - N\\nDo any members of your immediate family have a psychiatric illness?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a cramp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\n    - hypochondrium(L)\\n    - breast(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with depression?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from chronic anxiety?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel lightheaded and dizzy or do you feel like you are about to faint?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had numbness, loss of sensation or tingling, in both arms and legs and around your mouth?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Panic attack\\n- PSVT\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Stable angina\\n- Anemia\\n- GERD\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Inguinal hernia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- SLE\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 66-year-old male reports feeling anxious, with a cramp-like pain in the right side of the chest. He does not have any immediate family members with psychiatric illnesses. Pain is described as a \"cramp,\" not a typical anatomic site, and the intensity is rated at 3. Pain does not radiate. The location is described as the side of the chest, not the iliac fossa or hypochondrium, which are more typical sites of thoracic pain. There is no history of shortness of breath. He denies a history of depression or chronic anxiety, but mentions feeling lightheaded and dizzy. He does not have numbness or tingling in the arms and legs. No recent travel history. He denies a history of asthma or bronchodilator use, and there is no history of anemia, pericarditis, or unstable angina. No recent experience with chest pain or dizziness, and no history of unstable angina. The anterior wall of the inferior myocardial infarction (STEMI) criteria are not met. The radiographic features of pulmonary embolism are not present. The patient has no history of sarcoidosis, pan- or chagasic disease, or Guillain-Barré syndrome. He does not have a history of GERD, atrial fibrillation, inguinal hernia, or boerhaave's reaction. The patient has not traveled internationally in the last four weeks.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inaccuracies and lacks clarity, which impacts its explainability. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Incorrect Summary of Input Data**: The response begins by misrepresenting the input data. The INPUT states that the patient does not feel anxious, yet the response incorrectly describes him as reporting anxiety.\n\n2. **Misinterpretation of Pain Description**: The initial response does not consistently match the described locations of pain with the details in the INPUT. For instance, the INPUT mentions pain in the side of the chest (right), iliac fossa (right), hypochondrium (left), and breast (left), but the response simplifies this in a way that is not transparent.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Medical Conditions**: The reasoning lacks depth and fails to justify why conditions like panic attack (the correct label) are excluded or selected, nor does it provide a comprehensive analysis for concluding \"unstable angina.\"\n\n4. **Missing Context and Justification**: The response neither sufficiently explores nor explains the diagnostic process leading to the conclusion. It lacks detailed reasoning about why other diagnoses were ruled out or were less likely.\n\nGiven these points, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not provide a clear, informative, or persuasive account that medical experts could follow or trust. It falls short in providing a well-structured explanation that justifies the diagnostic reasoning in a logical manner.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
