Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 49\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - sensitive\\n    - tugging\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\n    - hypochondrium(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hiatal hernia?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had stools that were black (like coal)?\\n    - N\\nDo you think you are pregnant or are you currently pregnant?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- GERD\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Anemia\\n- Stable angina\\n- Boerhaave'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 49-year-old female with chest pain that starts in her stomach and makes it feel like coal.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and contains incorrect summaries of information from the INPUT. The female patient does not report chest pain that \"starts in her stomach and makes it feel like coal.\" The evidence provided in the INPUT contradicts this claim, as the patient does not describe a burning sensation starting in the stomach leading to the throat. The reasoning in the analysis of the differential diagnoses is not clearly articulated. The analysis misrepresents symptoms and the logic for excluding or including potential diagnoses is weak. For instance, the claim about Boerhaave's symptoms is inaccurate and the interpretation of GERD symptoms is not aligned with the information provided. The conclusion lacks solid justification as it jumps to pericarditis without clear rationale. The response also misrepresents some symptoms by mentioning criteria that are not specifically highlighted or contradicted by the INPUT. Overall, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not provide enough precise and logical reasoning for medical experts to follow, making it difficult to trust the conclusions. Therefore, the response is not well-structured or informative enough for the intended audience of medical experts. \n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
