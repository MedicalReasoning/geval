Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 45\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - mouth\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - nose\\n    - eye(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - back of head\\n    - nose\\n    - temple(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nHave you lost your sense of smell?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had pneumonia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have polyps in your nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a deviated nasal septum?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you more likely to develop common allergies than the general population?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 45-year-old female with sharp pain in her forehead, cheek(L), nose, eye(R), and a 3 on a scale of 1-10 for the intensity.

    "prediction": "The initial response demonstrates a lack of clarity and accuracy in addressing the input facts and its options. Here's why:\n\n1. **Incorrect Descriptions and Mismatches**: \n    - Viral Pharyngitis: The response incorrectly associates sharp pain in the throat with the symptoms presented, which do not align since the patient does not mention throat pain.\n    - Chronic Rhinosinusitis: While the input describes facial pain issues, the response fails to address how these symptoms could relate to sinus conditions, which is actually more aligned with the input.\n    - URTI: Incorrectly referred as \"Urinary tract infection,\" when it typically indicates an upper respiratory tract infection, showing a fundamental misunderstanding.\n    \n2. **Inadequate Justifications and Deductions**: \n    - The conclusion claiming \"The most likely diagnosis is Viral pharyngitis\" lacks a justified rationale based on the symptom evidence, particularly as many relevant symptoms of viral pharyngitis like sore throat or cough are not present in the input. \n    \n3. **Overall Lack of Clarity and Contextual Analysis**:\n    - The response does not accurately consider the intensity, absence of nasal congestion, or lack of other indicative factors, missing key analytical depth expected for consistency with medical expertise.\n    \nOverall, the response fails to communicate complex medical information in a clear, accurate, and persuasive manner as required. \n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
