Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 51\\nSex: M\\nDo you have an active cancer?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - a knife stroke\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - scapula(R)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nHave you been unable to move or get up for more than 3 consecutive days within the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have swelling in one or more areas of your body?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - posterior aspect of the ankle(L)\\n    - calf(L)\\nHave you had surgery within the last month?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Ebola\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- GERD\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 51-year-old male without any signs of active cancer, coughing up blood, and pain in the right lower chest.

    "prediction": "The initial response attempts to consider each potential diagnosis option, but it has several significant issues:\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of Symptoms**: The initial response mischaracterizes the symptoms. It mentions \"pain in the right lower chest\" while the input actually describes pain in multiple locations including \"lower chest,\" \"side of the chest (R),\" \"side of the chest (L),\" \"scapula (L),\" and \"posterior chest wall (L).\" It also fails to acknowledge the radiating nature of the pain, as the input indicates radiation to various other areas like \"scapula (R)\", \"scapula (L)\", etc.\n\n2. **Inaccuracies in Analyzing Options**: The analysis of options is flawed. For example, the initial response dismisses conditions as \"not typical for this age\" without medical justification. Some options, such as Myocarditis, are ruled out due to their age rather than based on symptoms, which is contrary to recognized medical understanding.\n\n3. **Rationale for Dismissal**: The response lacks a clear rationale for why certain potential diagnoses are dismissed. The term \"not typical for this age\" is not appropriately used; for instance, NSTEMI/STEMI and unstable angina could certainly be considered for a 51-year-old male.\n\n4. **Conclusion and Explanation**: The conclusion that \"Myocarditis\" is most probable does not align with the provided symptoms and seems arbitrary. There's an inconsistency, as the initial analysis lists it as \"not typical,\" but later it’s surprisingly identified as the most likely condition.\n\n5. **Accuracy**: The actual condition as per the task is \"Pulmonary embolism,\" but the response incorrectly identifies it as \"Myocarditis.\" The explanations provided for dismissals are oversimplifications and often incorrect.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No``` \n\nThe initial response is unclear and fails to provide a well-reasoned, medically sound explanation suitable for medical experts."
