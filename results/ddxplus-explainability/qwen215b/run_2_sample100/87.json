Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 77\\nSex: M\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - sensitive\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - temple(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Influenza\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 77-year-old male who does not live with four or more people. He describes his pain as tedious and feels it in his temple, with the pain localized to the top of his head, 2 on a 1-10 scale. The pain does not radiate. He does not have a fever or a sore throat. He does not have nasal congestion or a runny nose. He did not travel out of the country in the last four weeks and is not exposed to secondhand smoke. His chest pain is not related to lung or respiratory diseases.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- URTI: Common, but not tedious and localized to one area.\n- Bronchitis: Common, but not tedious.\n- Influenza: Common, but not tedious, localized to the top of the head.\n- Tuberculosis: Not common.\n- HIV (initial infection): Not common.\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis: Not common.\n- Chagas: Not common.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is URTI, as it is common and not related to the other options.\n\n```URTI```\n\nLABEL:\nURTI\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provided is explanatory to some extent, but it seems to lack clarity and detailed reasoning in some areas. Here's my evaluation:\n\n1. The response does lay out the patient's symptoms and lifestyle factors clearly. However, it lacks a detailed explanation as to why these symptoms lead to the conclusion of URTI. For instance, it mentions the pain is \"tedious\", but there is no exploration or connection made towards this symptom being part of URTI.\n\n2. It labels some conditions as \"not common\" but doesn't explain what makes them uncommon relative to the patient's description or why this patient wouldn't fit those conditions, given age and other risk factors.\n\n3. The decision for URTI seems mostly driven by a process of elimination, but the connections between specific symptoms and why they rule other conditions out (or rule URTI in) aren't explicitly made.\n\n4. The reasoning for excluding other diseases like bronchitis, influenza, tuberculosis, etc., is not persuasive or elaborated upon beyond simply stating they are \"not common\" or \"not tedious\".\n\n5. The use of terms like \"tedious\", which is not a typical descriptor used in medical symptoms, is not well justified or explained in its relevance.\n\nOverall, while the response has some elements of step-by-step reasoning, it ultimately fails to provide a deeply insightful or compelling explanation on why URTI is determined as the diagnosis. Therefore, it lacks in providing well-articulated justifications necessary for a medical expert audience.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
