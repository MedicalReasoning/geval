Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 48\\nSex: F\\nDo you have Rheumatoid Arthritis?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis (UC)?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had pneumonia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you immunosuppressed?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 48-year-old female presenting with symptoms of coughing up blood (negative for pneumonia, COPD, or other lung diseases), shortness of breath (negative for bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and bronchospasm/cough exacerbation), and anemia (negative for myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders).\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nBronchitis: May present with blood in sputum but usually due to inflammation.\n\nBronchiectasis: Involves atelectasis and hypoxemia.\n\nPneumonia: May cause cough and shortness of breath.\n\nPulmonary neoplasm: Can be diagnosed through imaging.\n\nAcute COPD exacerbation/infection: May present with shortness of breath.\n\nTuberculosis: Common in the upper respiratory tract.\n\nPulmonary embolism: Usually caused by a blood clot.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome: Rare.\n\nBronchospasm/acute asthma exacerbation: May be seen in asthmatics.\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Heart rhythm disorder.\n\nMyocarditis: Cardiac inflammation.\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Neurological.\n\nMyasthenia gravis: Muscle weakness.\n\nAnemia: Red blood cell problems.\n\nPSVT: Potential indication of a cardiac issue.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is **Tuberculosis**.\n\n```Tuberculosis```\n\nLABEL:\nBronchiectasis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not provide a clear, informative, and persuasive explanation for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The response begins by incorrectly summarizing the presented symptoms and conditions—coughing up blood is reported as negative, contrary to the statement in the reasoning. Moreover, the individual evidences and options are mentioned only superficially, without adequate contextual justification or a clear step-by-step reasoning process. The final conclusion of tuberculosis does not logically follow from the presented symptoms and analyses, especially given that the INPUT indicates a lack of relevant positive symptoms for tuberculosis (e.g., recent travel history, immunosuppression). Overall, the explanation lacks coherence and comprehensive analysis expected by a medical expert audience.\n\nTherefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks explainability and does not meet the criterion.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
