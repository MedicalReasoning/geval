Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 70\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - occiput\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Influenza\\n- Bronchitis\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 70-year-old female with no fever, no sore throat, no diffuse muscle pain, no nasal congestion, no cough, no travel, and having a pain that feels \"sensitive\" and radiates to the top of the head.

    "prediction": "Upon reviewing the INITIAL RESPONSE, I have noticed several issues regarding explainability:\n\n1. The initial response attempted to summarize the patient's symptoms but incorrectly included information such as \"a rash on her cheeks,\" which was not present in the INPUT.\n\n2. The analysis of the options contained some inaccuracies and lacked clear reasoning. For example, URTI (Upper Respiratory Tract Infection) was dismissed based on age without sufficient explanation, despite the absence of typical URTI symptoms.\n\n3. Similarly, Influenza was prematurely marked as common in the summer without relevance to the given symptoms or season in the INPUT.\n\n4. The reasoning for determining Chronic rhinosinusitis as the most likely diagnosis was not well-articulated. There was no link between the decision and the specifics of the patient's medical profile presented in the INPUT.\n\n5. There was a lack of comprehensive justification or medical rationale tying the patient's symptoms to the suggested diagnosis, making the conclusions appear hasty and unsubstantiated.\n\nGiven these points, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not effectively communicate medical information with clarity and fails to provide an explainable analysis suitable for medical experts. \n\nTherefore, the evaluation for explainability is: \n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
