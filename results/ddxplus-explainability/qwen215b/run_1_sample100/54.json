Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 67\\nSex: F\\nDo you have chest pain even at rest?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a spontaneous pneumothorax?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heartbreaking\\n    - violent\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - breast(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that are increased with physical exertion but alleviated with rest?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- GERD\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 67-year-old female without any known history of spontaneous pneumothorax, no chest pain at rest, no pain related to her condition, no pain in specific locations, no pain radiating, no pain intensity, no pain location, no pain speed, no smoking history, no recent travel, no symptoms related to physical exertion, and no previous history of chest pain.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nUnstable angina: Unlikely due to the absence of chest pain.\n\nStable angina: Unlikely due to the absence of chest pain and no previous history.\n\nPossible NSTEMI / STEMI: Unlikely due to the absence of chest pain.\n\nGERD: Common cause of chest pain but not with such symptoms.\n\nPericarditis: Unlikely due to the absence of chest pain.\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Unlikely due to the absence of chest pain.\n\nSpontaneous pneumothorax: Likely because of the chest pain described and the absence of any other symptoms.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is Spontaneous pneumothorax.\n\n```Spontaneous pneumothorax```\n\nLABEL:\nSpontaneous pneumothorax\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE appears to misinterpret key details from the INPUT, creating a lack of clarity and failing to provide well-reasoned medical conclusions. It incorrectly states that the individual has no pain, intensity, or specific pain locations, which contradicts the given evidence which indicates high-intensity pain in multiple locations (lower chest, side of the chest (R), upper chest, breast (R), breast (L), heartbeat and violent nature). The reasoning process is flawed, leading to the conclusion that Spontaneous pneumothorax is the most likely diagnosis, despite the patient reporting no spontaneous pneumothorax history. Therefore, the response lacks clarity and coherence, making it difficult for medical experts to understand and trust the diagnosis.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
