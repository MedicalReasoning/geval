Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 19\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - occiput\\n    - temple(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- URTI\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 19-year-old female who has not been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks, and does not attend or work in a daycare.

    "prediction": "The initial response provided is not explainable based on the given criterion for several reasons:\n\n1. **Inaccurate Information**: The response incorrectly states that there is no pain anywhere, which is contradictory to the patient's description of pain locations, such as the top of the head, forehead, cheek, occiput, and temple.\n\n2. **Misinterpretation of Symptoms**: The response fails to accurately interpret the character and location of the pain. It claims that \"Cluster headache\" and \"Chagas\" are incorrectly evaluated and lacks thorough reasoning for excluding them.\n\n3. **Flawed Differential Diagnosis**: The response claims \"Bronchitis\" as the most probable diagnosis, but this is not supported by the evidence provided (e.g., upper respiratory tract involvement or headache-like symptoms), and it overlooks the more appropriate option like \"URTI.\"\n\n4. **Logical Inconsistencies**: There are logical inconsistencies, such as dismissing cluster headache based on the descriptor \"tedious\" and \"heavy,\" without due consideration of the location-based symptoms, which heavily point towards headache-related issues more than to bronchitis.\n\nThe response lacks clarity, precision, and an informed reasoning process necessary for persuading or informing medical experts. Therefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to meet transparency and context adequacy requirements.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
