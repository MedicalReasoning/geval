Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 38\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - exhausting\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - biceps(R)\\n    - biceps(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - thoracic spine\\n    - shoulder(R)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you constantly feel fatigued or do you have non-restful sleep?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you exercise regularly, 4 times per week or more?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that are increased with physical exertion but alleviated with rest?\\n    - N\\nDo you have close family members who had a cardiovascular disease problem before the age of 50?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Panic attack\\n- Anemia\\n- GERD\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- SLE\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Chagas\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- PSVT\\n- Pulmonary embolism'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 38-year-old female with a characterizing chest pain of tiredness and exhaustion in the left side of the chest, with a painless discomfort localized to the left side of the chest with a dull ache and a 5 on a scale of 1-10.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provides a breakdown of the patient's symptoms but inaccurately describes them. The response misquotes several aspects of the provided evidence, such as claiming the pain does not radiate anywhere and is localized, which is contradictory to the evidence indicating radiating pain to multiple areas (biceps, thyroid cartilage, thoracic spine, shoulder). The response presumes the pain is at the heart level without evidence from the input, and it incorrectly states there is no pain radiating and the pain is more severe when standing, which are not present in the evidence provided. Furthermore, the suggestion of \"unstable angina\" does not logically derive from the evidence, as the symptoms do not strongly indicate angina without exertion-related pain or a history of cardiovascular issues, whereas the label given is \"Stable angina\". Overall, while the response steps through the process of diagnosis, it does so with inaccuracies and a lack of clarity, making it potentially misleading for medical experts.\n\nGiven these considerations, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks the necessary explainability and clarity needed for medical professionals to understand and trust the rationale behind the suggested diagnosis.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
