Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 28\\nSex: M\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high blood pressure or do you take medications to treat high blood pressure?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known heart defect?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating very irregularly or in a disorganized pattern?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Atrial fibrillation\\n- PSVT\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Anemia\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Myocarditis\\n- SLE\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBased on the given information, the patient lacks any definitive cardiovascular issues, and there are additional symptoms not related to cardiovascular disease.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Not likely given no heart-specific symptoms.\n\nPSVT: Possible if related to heart rhythm issues.\n\nPulmonary embolism: Not likely based on lack of symptoms.\n\nAnemia: Not likely given no symptoms.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome: Not likely based on history.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome: Not likely based on history.\n\nScombroid food poisoning: Not likely given lack of symptoms.\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Not likely based on history.\n\nMyasthenia gravis: Not likely based on history.\n\nAnaphylaxis: Not likely based on history.\n\nMyocarditis: Not likely based on history.\n\nSLE: Not likely based on history.\n\nChagas: Not likely based on travel history.\n\nPossible NSTEMI / STEMI: Not likely based on lack of symptoms.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n```Chagas```\n- Chagas\n\nLABEL:\nAtrial fibrillation\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",
