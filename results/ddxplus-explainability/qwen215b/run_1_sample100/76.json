Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 25\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your vaccinations up to date?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms more prominent at night?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Allergic sinusitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- GERD\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- URTI\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Influenza\\n- Stable angina\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe patient is a 25-year-old male with a burning pain in the lower chest.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE to the medical case presents an analysis that is structured but fundamentally flawed. While the author attempts to eliminate potential diagnoses by mentioning the symptoms or characteristics associated with each, the reasoning displays misunderstandings and inaccuracies. Notably, the patient's description does not mention difficulty in breathing when exhaling or symptoms being more prominent at night, despite these being referred to in the initial reasoning. These errors imply that the initial response relies on incorrect symptom interpretations, leading to an incorrect final diagnosis of \"Unstable angina\" as opposed to \"Bronchitis,\" which the label suggests is the correct answer.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE is unclear in its explanation due to contradictions with the provided patient's symptoms, a lack of context connecting each diagnosis to the symptomatic presentation, and a divergent conclusion from the intended label. Thus, it lacks the clarity and detail necessary for a medical expert audience to follow or trust the information.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
