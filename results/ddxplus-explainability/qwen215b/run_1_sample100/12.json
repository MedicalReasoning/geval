Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 49\\nSex: F\\nDo you have an active cancer?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - scapula(R)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you currently take hormones?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - nowhere\\nDid you lose consciousness?\\n    - N\\nHave you had surgery within the last month?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America', 'options': '- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Panic attack\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Ebola\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 49-year-old female with symptoms of coughing up blood, pain on the side of the chest, sensitivity to pain, and shortness of breath.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provided lacks clarity and accuracy in its analysis. Although it attempts to summarize the case and analyze possible diagnoses, it introduces incorrect information such as the patient having symptoms like \"coughing up blood\" and \"shortness of breath,\" which contradicts the INPUT data. Additionally, the response makes vague and unsupported conclusions about various conditions being \"not typical\" without providing proper medical rationale or context for each dismissal. Furthermore, the final conclusion of \"Acute pulmonary edema\" is contradictory to the LABEL \"Pulmonary embolism,\" and the reasoning for this conclusion is not explained competently. Overall, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not present information in a way that is easily understandable and trustworthy for medical experts, as it fails to support its assertions with valid explanations or logical reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the explainability of the INITIAL RESPONSE is unsatisfactory. \n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
