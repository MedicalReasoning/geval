Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 4\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - sensitive\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - burning\\n    - scary\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - hypochondrium(R)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hiatal hernia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that get worse after eating?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N', 'options': '- GERD\\n- Anaphylaxis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 4-year-old male with a sensation of a knife stroke and burning sensation, most intense in the upper chest, radiating to the throat, with no elevation of blood pressure, no temperature, no dark urine.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE presents an analysis of symptoms and evaluates the two possible diagnoses: GERD and Anaphylaxis. However, the response is not clear and precise due to several issues:\n\n1. The response includes information not present in the INPUT, like \"radiating to the throat,\" \"with no elevation of blood pressure,\" \"no temperature,\" and \"no dark urine,\" which creates confusion since these details were not provided in the INPUT.\n2. The reasoning for considering \"GERD: Possible, but not typically associated with 4-year-old children\" is not adequately justified or explained, especially since the symptoms described (pain and burning sensation) do not align with typical GERD symptoms, where eating or lying down often exacerbates conditions, contrary to the INPUT.\n3. The dismissal of Anaphylaxis is not explained; the response simply states it without supporting why the symptoms do not match.\n4. Despite stating GERD is \"possible but not typical,\" the response concludes it to be the \"most probable diagnosis\" without sufficient justification or addressing the age-related concerns.\n\nThe explanation fails to provide medical experts with a clear, logical, and evidence-based conclusion, leading to a lack of explainability.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
