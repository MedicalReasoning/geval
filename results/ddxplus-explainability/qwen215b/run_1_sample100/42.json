Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 49\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - sensitive\\n    - tugging\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\n    - hypochondrium(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hiatal hernia?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had stools that were black (like coal)?\\n    - N\\nDo you think you are pregnant or are you currently pregnant?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- GERD\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Anemia\\n- Stable angina\\n- Boerhaave'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 49-year-old female with chest pain that starts in her stomach and makes it feel like coal.

    "prediction": "The initial response mentions symptoms that are not present in the input, such as \"chest pain that starts in her stomach and makes it feel like coal,\" which is not an accurate representation of the given information. This incorrect interpretation affects the clarity and accuracy of the evaluation. Additionally, the analysis of conditions is brief and lacks detailed justification, making it difficult for medical experts to follow the reasoning and trust the conclusions. It incorrectly dismisses certain conditions or applies incorrect symptoms to them, like associating Boerhaave with heartburn, which is not mentioned in the symptoms, or linking pericarditis with heartburn. Overall, the response is not well-articulated and lacks coherence in its reasoning, failing to accurately address the provided symptoms.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
