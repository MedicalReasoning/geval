Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 64\\nSex: M\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you had chills or shivers?\\n    - N\\nDo you have Parkinson’s disease?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had pneumonia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any lesions, redness or problems on your skin that you believe are related to the condition you are consulting for?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - pink\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - Y\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - back of the neck\\n    - lumbar spine\\n    - commissure(R)\\n    - commissure(L)\\n    - buttock(R)\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - N\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHave you recently had a loss of appetite or do you get full more quickly then usually?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed any new fatigue, generalized and vague discomfort, diffuse (widespread) muscle aches or a change in your general well-being related to your consultation today?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nIs your BMI less than 18.5, or are you underweight?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms more prominent at night?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pneumonia\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack\\n- Influenza\\n- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- URTI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 64-year-old male with coughing up blood and chest pain, characterizing as a knife stroke, feeling it on the right side.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provided does not accurately reflect the INPUT data, which significantly undermines its explainability.\n\n1. Misinterpretation of Data: The response mentions \"coughing up blood,\" \"eye redness,\" and \"painful urination,\" none of which are present in the INPUT data. This working method could mislead medical experts trying to follow the reasoning process.\n\n2. Conclusion without Justification: The selection of \"Pneumonia\" as a diagnosis is stated without adequately connecting the INPUT data or elaborating on the reasoning behind discarding other potential diagnoses. While Pneumonia is listed as a common cause of coughing up blood, the patient in the INPUT clearly reported \"No\" for coughing up blood, making the conclusion unjustified.\n\n3. Irrelevant Information: The response includes details that do not pertain to the patient, such as \"chlamydia infection 2 weeks ago,\" which is neither mentioned in the INPUT nor relevant to the current symptoms described.\n\nGiven these discrepancies, the response fails to provide a clear, informative, and persuasive explanation based on the provided evidence. As such, it does not meet the criterion of explainability for a medical expert audience.\n\nPREDICTION: ```PREDICTION```No```"
