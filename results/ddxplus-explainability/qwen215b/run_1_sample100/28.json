Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 10\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you immunosuppressed?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Influenza\\n- Pneumonia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 10-year-old girl with sore throat, cough, tonsil pain, and no fever.

    "prediction": "The initial response begins by incorrectly summarizing the symptoms, including a \"cough\" that was not present in the provided input. This misinterpretation of symptoms is a significant oversight and leads to confusion. Moreover, the initial response lacks depth in its analysis of each potential diagnosis. It does not provide detailed reasoning or medical basis for excluding each option, nor does it discuss the presence or absence of specific symptoms like \"pain location\" or the \"intensity\" which could be relevant for narrowing down the options.\n\nFor instance, the discussion of \"Tuberculosis\" is oversimplified without consideration of other relevant factors, and \"Viral pharyngitis\" is chosen without adequately contrasting the symptoms to other options. The reasoning for dismissing conditions like influenza and pneumonia is brief and lacks detailed medical explanation, leaving medical experts without clear insights into the decision-making process.\n\nThis lack of clarity and justification prevents medical experts from trusting the conclusion, making the initial response unexplainable by the standard set forth.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
