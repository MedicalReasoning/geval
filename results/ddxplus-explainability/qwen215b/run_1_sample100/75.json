Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 91\\nSex: F\\nAre you currently being treated or have you recently been treated with an oral antibiotic for an ear infection?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - ear(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nAre you more irritable or has your mood been very unstable recently?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your vaccinations up to date?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute otitis media'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nTo think step-by-step:\n\nGiven age and sex, the patient is elderly.

    "prediction": "1. The INITIAL RESPONSE makes an incorrect statement regarding the patient's treatment with oral antibiotics, mentioning that the patient is currently or recently treated with them for an ear infection, when the INPUT clearly states 'N' for that question.\n2. The reasoning provided is somewhat generic and doesn't delve deeply into justifications for why acute otitis media is the most likely diagnosis considering the absence of some typical symptoms like fever or antibiotic treatment.\n3. There is a slight confusion in the INITIAL RESPONSE concerning otitis media with effusion, which is not the same as acute otitis media. The distinction is not properly clarified, which could lead to misunderstanding among medical experts regarding the considerations for diagnosis.\n4. Given these issues, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks some clarity and detailed justification needed to persuade a medical expert fully.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
