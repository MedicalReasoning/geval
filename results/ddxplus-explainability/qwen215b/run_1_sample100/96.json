Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 97\\nSex: M\\nDo you have chest pain even at rest?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a spontaneous pneumothorax?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heartbreaking\\n    - violent\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - breast(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nHave any of your family members ever had a pneumothorax?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that are increased with physical exertion but alleviated with rest?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Unstable angina\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Stable angina\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Panic attack\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\n```Spontaneous pneumothorax```\n\nThe patient is a 97-year-old male with chest pain at rest and no previous history of chest pain or pneumothorax. The pain is described as \"heartbreaking\" and is centered in the left chest, with no radiating pain. The intensity of the pain is rated as 7 out of 10. The pain does not radiate, nor does it affect shortness of breath or breathing. There are no risk factors for other conditions (aging, smoking, travel, family history, etc.). The pain is not increased by physical exertion or alleviated by rest, nor does it occur when breathing deeply. The pain is not related to other conditions that are more concerning (angina, coronary events, heart failure, myocarditis, etc.). The patient is not experiencing any acute conditions that are life-threatening or need immediate medical attention.\n\nLABEL:\nSpontaneous pneumothorax\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE identifies \"Spontaneous pneumothorax\" as the diagnosis for the 97-year-old male patient with specific chest pain characteristics. However, the explanation has inaccuracies and lacks clarity. \n\n1. The response incorrectly states that the patient has \"chest pain at rest\", but the input specifies the patient does not have chest pain at rest.\n2. The response claims the pain is centered in the left chest, yet the input notes pain in the \"breast(R)\", indicating the right side.\n3. The response omits a rationale for Spontaneous pneumothorax despite indicating the pain does not affect breathing or have related symptomatology. It also leaves out any discussion on why other diseases were ruled out, particularly considering the patient's age and symptomatology.\n4. The response fails to adequately address how the patient's symptom profile, such as pain description and intensity, might align with Spontaneous pneumothorax or justify why Spontaneous pneumothorax was preferred over other potential diagnoses listed, such as NSTEMI/STEMI or acute conditions.\n\nDue to the incorrect interpretations of the input data and lack of thorough reasoning for the chosen label, this response does not meet criteria for clear, informative, and persuasive communication to medical experts.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
