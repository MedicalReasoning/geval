Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 66\\nSex: F\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - occiput\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Influenza\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchitis\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Chagas\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 66-year-old woman with increased sweating, no pain associated, and subjective heavy pain on the top of the head, cheek(R), cheek(L), and occiput.

    "prediction": "The evaluation of the INITIAL RESPONSE reveals some issues in clarity, accuracy, and logical reasoning:\n\n1. Factual Inaccuracy: The INITIAL RESPONSE states \"A 66-year-old woman with increased sweating\" which conflicts with the INPUT where the patient reported no increased sweating.\n\n2. Misinterpretation: The INITIAL RESPONSE mentions \"no pain associated,\" contradicting the detailed responses provided in INPUT, which include pain described as heavy and rated 6 out of 10 in specific areas.\n\n3. Logical Reasoning: The response lists potential conditions provided in the options, attempting to correlate them with symptoms. However, the suggested diagnosis of URTI (\"Upper Respiratory Tract Infection\") seems poorly justified as the patient's symptoms (pain without upper respiratory symptoms like cough, congestion, fever, or sore throat) don't align with typical URTI presentations.\n\n4. Lack of Clarity: The structure of the analysis lacks clear reasoning behind the chosen diagnosis. The response does not explain why URTI is selected over other options, particularly when symptoms doe not obviously match.\n\nGiven these points, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and coherence needed to be informative or persuasive to a medical expert. It fails to properly interpret the INPUT data and doesn't provide transparent reasoning for the proposed diagnosis.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
