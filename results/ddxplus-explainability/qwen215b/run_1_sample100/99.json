Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 66\\nSex: M\\nDo you feel anxious?\\n    - N\\nDo any members of your immediate family have a psychiatric illness?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a cramp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\n    - hypochondrium(L)\\n    - breast(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with depression?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from chronic anxiety?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel lightheaded and dizzy or do you feel like you are about to faint?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had numbness, loss of sensation or tingling, in both arms and legs and around your mouth?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Panic attack\\n- PSVT\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Stable angina\\n- Anemia\\n- GERD\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Inguinal hernia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- SLE\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 66-year-old male reports feeling anxious, with a cramp-like pain in the right side of the chest. He does not have any immediate family members with psychiatric illnesses. Pain is described as a \"cramp,\" not a typical anatomic site, and the intensity is rated at 3. Pain does not radiate. The location is described as the side of the chest, not the iliac fossa or hypochondrium, which are more typical sites of thoracic pain. There is no history of shortness of breath. He denies a history of depression or chronic anxiety, but mentions feeling lightheaded and dizzy. He does not have numbness or tingling in the arms and legs. No recent travel history. He denies a history of asthma or bronchodilator use, and there is no history of anemia, pericarditis, or unstable angina. No recent experience with chest pain or dizziness, and no history of unstable angina. The anterior wall of the inferior myocardial infarction (STEMI) criteria are not met. The radiographic features of pulmonary embolism are not present. The patient has no history of sarcoidosis, pan- or chagasic disease, or Guillain-Barré syndrome. He does not have a history of GERD, atrial fibrillation, inguinal hernia, or boerhaave's reaction. The patient has not traveled internationally in the last four weeks.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provides a series of assessments related to the patient's symptoms and possible diagnoses from the given options. However, there are several issues with its clarity and precision which impact its explainability:\n\n1. **Error in Content**: The INITIAL RESPONSE states the patient reports feeling anxious, which contradicts the INPUT where the patient denies feeling anxious. This inconsistency might confuse medical experts as the response is reliant on inaccurate information.\n\n2. **Incoherence in Explanation**: While attempting to eliminate diagnoses, the initial response mentions various symptoms and histories without clearly linking them or explaining why certain conditions are ruled out. For instance, the mention of \"radiographic features of pulmonary embolism are not present\" lacks context as no imaging data was provided.\n\n3. **Redundancy and Repetition**: There is an unnecessary repetition of conditions being ruled out without adequate justification. This does not streamline the process or make it easier to follow, causing potential information overload.\n\n4. **Conclusion Mismatch**: The INITIAL RESPONSE concludes with \"Unstable angina,\" which does not align with the LABEL \"Panic attack.\" It lacks a clear thread that leads logically to either conclusion, which is essential for expert understanding.\n\nThese factors make the response convoluted and less informative or persuasive for a medical expert. It fails to provide a transparent and well-reasoned explanation for its conclusions.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
