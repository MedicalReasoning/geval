Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 73\\nSex: F\\nDo you have a poor diet?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a diagnosis of anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any family members who have been diagnosed with anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tugging\\n    - exhausting\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - temple(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel so tired that you are unable to do your usual activities or are you stuck in your bed all day long?\\n    - N\\nDo you constantly feel fatigued or do you have non-restful sleep?\\n    - N\\nDo you have chronic kidney failure?\\n    - N\\nAre you taking any new oral anticoagulants ((NOACs)?\\n    - N\\nIs your skin much paler than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you think you are pregnant or are you currently pregnant?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North Africa\\nIs your BMI less than 18.5, or are you underweight?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Anemia\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Chagas\\n- Cluster headache\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- SLE\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 73-year-old female with a history of anemia and pain mostly in the temple region, characterized as \"tugging\" and \"exhausting\", with no radiating pain.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and crucial information. For instance, it incorrectly mentions a \"history of anemia,\" though the INPUT specifies there is none. Also, the pain is not described properly as chronic, which was an assumption without basis in the given details. The detailed breakdown of each potential diagnosis is superficial and lacks a clear rationale connecting symptoms to each option provided. Additionally, the final assertion that \"the most likely diagnosis is Anemia\" is not well-aligned with the data provided, as the patient has no history of anemia, dietary issues, or symptoms typically consistent with anemia. The response overlooks presenting a logical flow of reasoning, which is essential for medical experts to find the analysis compelling and understandable. Therefore, the response is not explained well and lacks substantiation for its conclusions.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
