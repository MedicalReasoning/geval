Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 4\\nSex: M\\nDo you have a poor diet?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a diagnosis of anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - tugging\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - back of head\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - temple(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel so tired that you are unable to do your usual activities or are you stuck in your bed all day long?\\n    - N\\nDo you constantly feel fatigued or do you have non-restful sleep?\\n    - N\\nDo you have chronic kidney failure?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had stools that were black (like coal)?\\n    - N\\nAre you taking any new oral anticoagulants ((NOACs)?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed light red blood or blood clots in your stool?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nIs your BMI less than 18.5, or are you underweight?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Anemia\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Myocarditis\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA newborn with a poor diet, anemia, and no signs of pain.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE is neither clear nor informative in explaining the medical reasoning. Firstly, there is a mistake in restating the symptoms and context: the INPUT describes a 4-year-old without anemia, a newborn with a poor diet, and no current sleep issues, whereas the INITIAL RESPONSE discusses a newborn with those issues. This confusion creates a foundational error in evaluating the symptoms and possible diagnosis. \n\nAdditionally, the reasoning does not justify why Anemia is selected, given that anemia was not previously diagnosed nor are there suggestive anemic symptoms in the evidences provided. The explanations provided for excluding other diagnoses are simplistic and fail to consider the relevant information to understand the 4-year-old's symptoms thoroughly. The response lacks structured analysis, omit considerations of complex symptoms and does not offer sound medical knowledge suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\nFurthermore, the actual symptom presentation and reasoning process behind reaching the conclusion of Anemia is not robustly explained. As there is no elaboration on why each other diagnosis was ruled out accurately, it does not meet the standard for effective communication with medical professionals. \n\nFor these reasons, the clarity and informativeness required for understanding and trusting the response are missing, and the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to provide adequate justification or logical explanation for its claims.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
