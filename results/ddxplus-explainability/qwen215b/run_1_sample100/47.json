Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 26\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Influenza\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Chagas\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 26-year-old female with no history of fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose, or cough.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several issues affecting explainability:\n\n1. Incorrect information: It states the individual \"attended a daycare,\" while the input specifies she does not attend or work in daycare. This mistake confuses the assessment and questions the response's reliability.\n\n2. Diagnostic reasoning: The rationale for excluding or considering various diagnoses is underexplained. For example, why 'HIV' and 'Chagas' are dismissed based on presented criteria is not made clear.\n\n3. Lack of symptom analysis: The response doesn't discuss the symptoms listed, such as \"top of the head\" and \"cheek\" pain, or how these relate to suggested diagnoses.\n\n4. Logical structure: The conclusion abruptly lists \"URTI or Acute rhinosinusitis\" without thorough, persuasive reasoning based on presented evidence. \n\nOverall, while the response attempts logical reasoning, inaccuracies, lack of clarity in reasoning, and omission of relevant symptoms undermine its effectiveness and explainability for medical professionals.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
