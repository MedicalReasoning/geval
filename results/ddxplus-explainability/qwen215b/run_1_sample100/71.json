Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 31\\nSex: F\\nHave you been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known heart defect?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating very irregularly or in a disorganized pattern?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America', 'options': '- Atrial fibrillation\\n- PSVT\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 31-year-old female who feels dizzy, lightheaded, and is not in the middle of any acute cardiac events, having never been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism or heart disease.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Occurs with rapid, irregular heartbeat.\n\nPSVT: Paramyocardial supraventricular tachycardia.\n\nAnemia: Low red blood cells.\n\nScombroid food poisoning: Common after eating raw or undercooked seafood.\n\nAn anemia would cause fatigue, not lightheadedness, but this does not match her symptoms.\n\nHypothyroidism is not a common cause of lightheadedness.\n\nHypertension is not a cause of lightheadedness.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is a normal clinical presentation with no other major concerns.\n\n```Normal clinical presentation```\n\nLABEL:\nAtrial fibrillation\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provided is not highly explainable. The reasoning process lacks clarity and coherence, as there are discrepancies between what is mentioned in the context and the analysis provided. The respondent erroneously introduces symptoms and conditions not present in the INPUT (e.g., dizziness, lightheadedness) and discusses conditions not related to the presented options (e.g., hypothyroidism, hypertension) as potential diagnoses. Furthermore, the final statement suggesting a \"normal clinical presentation\" lacks sufficient justification and contradicts the LABEL \"Atrial fibrillation.\" The analysis does not convincingly align with the INPUT or LABEL, and the INITAL RESPONSE overall is confusing with respect to the logical reasoning required. \n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
