Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 51\\nSex: M\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high blood pressure or do you take medications to treat high blood pressure?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known heart defect?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating very irregularly or in a disorganized pattern?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Atrial fibrillation'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 51-year-old male with no known history of heart issues, high blood pressure, a heart attack or angina, no heart defect, no palpitations, no heart racing, no irregular heartbeats, no travel history.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Fits history.\n\n```Atrial fibrillation```\n\nLABEL:\nAtrial fibrillation\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provided does not adequately address the task of evaluating the probability of atrial fibrillation in the context of the given medical history. While the initial step correctly summarizes the patient's history, the analysis of the options is overly simplistic and lacks sufficient explanation. The statement \"Atrial fibrillation: Fits history\" does not provide a compelling or justified rationale for why atrial fibrillation fits the patient's history, especially when the provided evidence does not indicate any symptoms or conditions typically associated with atrial fibrillation. A medical expert would expect a more detailed explanation of reasoning, such as a discussion of risk factors beyond the answers provided in the input. This explanation should also consider why atrial fibrillation may or may not be relevant given the absence of symptoms or known risk factors. As a result, the response fails to meet the criteria for explainability.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
