Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 23\\nSex: M\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 23-year-old male with no history of contact, no living with multiple people, no pain related to the reason for consulting, no sensitive/nerve pain, no tonsil, thyroid cartilage, or pharynx pain, no jaw pain, no radiating pain, no precise location, no speed of onset, no nasal congestion, no travel, and no signs of a heart problem.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and misinterprets the information provided in the INPUT. It inaccurately summarizes the patient's symptoms and erroneously associates the symptoms with possible NSTEMI / STEMI. The patient clearly describes pain in multiple specific throat locations (tonsil, thyroid cartilage, pharynx, under the jaw) with an intensity of 7, which suggests an ENT-related issue rather than a cardiac one. However, the INITIAL RESPONSE disregards these details and incorrectly dismisses conditions like viral pharyngitis, which are more consistent with the reported symptoms. \n\nThere is a misunderstanding of the symptoms; thus, the reasoning and conclusions are not logically sound or relevant to the OUTPUT LABEL of \"Viral pharyngitis.\" Furthermore, the response does not transparently justify the claim that NSTEMI / STEMI aligns with the symptoms, thus failing to be convincing or informative for a medical expert audience. Hence, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not meet the explainability criterion.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
