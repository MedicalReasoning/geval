Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 1\\nSex: F\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you had a cold in the last 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that the tone of your voice has become deeper, softer or hoarse?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute laryngitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Acute otitis media\\n- Epiglottitis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n```Acute laryngitis```\n\nThe other options do not fit the clinical presentation:\n\n- Bronchitis: Persistent cough, fever, and difficulty breathing are typical.\n- Pneumonia: Cough, fever, chest pain, and difficulty breathing are common.\n- Tuberculosis: Continuous cough and weight loss are typical.\n- Viral pharyngitis: Pain, hoarseness, and fever are typical.\n- Acute otitis media: Ear pain, hearing loss, and fever are typical.\n- Chagas: Deafness, abdominal pain, and fever are typical.\n\nLABEL:\nAcute laryngitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not provide an adequate explanation for choosing \"Acute laryngitis\" as the diagnosis over the other options listed. The response does a reasonable job of detailing why the other conditions do not match the symptoms presented, but it fails to clearly and convincingly explain why \"Acute laryngitis\" is the most appropriate diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms. Moreover, it could benefit from further elaboration on why the absence of fever, cough, and hoarseness, which are sometimes seen with acute laryngitis, does not rule out this condition in the given case. The reasoning process is somewhat oversimplified and may leave medical experts questioning the diagnostic conclusion.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
