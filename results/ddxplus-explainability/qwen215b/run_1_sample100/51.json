Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 17\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pericarditis\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- PSVT\\n- GERD\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Panic attack\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 17-year-old female with a pain characterized as a knife stroke in the breast (L side) with a sharpness, rated 4 out of 10 on a scale from 0 to 10. The pain does not radiate, is not precise, and does not appear suddenly. She feels no shortness of breath, is not experiencing palpitations, has not traveled recently, and the pain is not worse when lying down. The pain is alleviated when sitting up.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- Pericarditis: Uncommon in this age and gender, and the symptoms don't match.\n\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax: Occurs in the chest, not the breast.\n\n- Pulmonary embolism: Can cause shortness of breath and chest pain.\n\n- PSVT: Not common in this age.\n\n- GERD: Possible but not a sharp, localized pain.\n\n- Atrial fibrillation: Causes palpitations but not shortness of breath.\n\n- Myocarditis: Typically causes symptoms like fever and chest pain.\n\n- Panic attack: Fit with the sudden onset and sharp pain.\n\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome: Can cause sharp pain but not in the breast.\n\n- Boerhaave: Rare but not sharp pain.\n\n- Scombroid food poisoning: Not sharp and not in the breast.\n\n- Acute dystonic reactions: Not sharp.\n\n- Myasthenia gravis: Can cause pain but not in the breast.\n\n- Anemia: Not sharp.\n\n- Sarcoidosis: Not sharp.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is Panic attack.\n\n```Panic attack```\n\nLABEL:\nPericarditis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

It contains some inaccuracies in its analysis, such as the pain's characteristics and the final conclusion, which incorrectly suggests a panic attack as the most likely diagnosis when the label suggested pericarditis. Additionally, there are factual inaccuracies, such as stating that pericarditis is uncommon in this age group, along with failing to conclusively explain why panic attack stands out over other options. The response lacks clarity in explaining the reasoning heavily to medical experts. Therefore, the explainability is not met.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
