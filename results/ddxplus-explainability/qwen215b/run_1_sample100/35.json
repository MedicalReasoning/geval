Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 23\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain that improves when you lean forward?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the neck(R)\\n    - side of the neck(L)\\n    - palace\\n    - under the jaw\\n    - trachea\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have difficulty swallowing, or have a feeling of discomfort/blockage when swallowing?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high blood pressure or do you take medications to treat high blood pressure?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that you produce more saliva than usual?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your vaccinations up to date?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Epiglottitis\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Larygospasm\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Stable angina\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Chagas\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 23-year-old female with pain that improves when leaning forward, pain in the neck (right) and side of the neck, pain sensation, difficulty swallowing, no fever, no high blood pressure, no exposure to infectious risk factors, no respiratory symptoms, no recent travel, and no symptoms of diabetes, alcohol use, or vaccinations.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nEpiglottitis: No symptoms of respiratory infection.\n\nMyasthenia gravis: Not clear from the symptoms.\n\nPossible NSTEMI / STEMI: Cardiovascular symptoms don't fit.\n\nUnstable angina: Similar symptoms but not severe enough.\n\nHIV (initial infection): HIV symptoms don't fit.\n\nLarygospasm: Can cause pain but not severe.\n\nAcute pulmonary edema: Sudden onset.\n\nStable angina: Typical presentation, not severe.\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Not clear from symptoms.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome: No symptoms.\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Pain from a toxin.\n\nCardiac conditions: Not severe enough.\n\nSLE: Not clear from symptoms.\n\nPulmonary embolism: Chest pain.\n\nScombroid food poisoning: No flavor or smell.\n\nPSVT: Not clear from symptoms.\n\nChagas: No symptoms.\n\nPulmonary embolism: Chest pain.\n\nPSVT and Chagas are similar symptoms but not clear from the symptoms.\n\nLarygospasm and Acute dystonic reactions are not severe enough.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is Acute pulmonary edema.\n\n```Acute pulmonary edema```\n\nLABEL:\nEpiglottitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provided does not accurately assess the situation based on the evidence given. The response states that the patient has pain that improves when leaning forward, but the input evidence specifically indicates that the pain does not improve when leaning forward (response to the question: \"Do you have pain that improves when you lean forward? - N\"). This is a critical oversight. Additionally, the INITIAL RESPONSE proceeds through the list of conditions rather abruptly, without thorough explanation as to why each condition is dismissed or considered. There is a lack of depth in the reasoning, failing to communicate why 'Acute pulmonary edema' is prioritized despite the absence of typical symptoms such as respiratory distress. Important details about symptoms are not matched accurately, and the decision for the most probable diagnosis is not well-supported or clearly justified. Therefore, the response lacks clarity, precision, and adequate explanation, making it difficult for medical experts to trust the conclusions drawn.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
