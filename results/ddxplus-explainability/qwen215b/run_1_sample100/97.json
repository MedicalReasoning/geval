Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 67\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - upper chest\\n    - pharynx\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your vaccinations up to date?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- URTI\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- GERD\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Panic attack\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Stable angina\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 67-year-old female with a sore throat, cough, and shortness of breath.

    "prediction": "The initial response incorrectly states that the patient has a sore throat, cough, and shortness of breath, which contradicts the evidence provided. Based on the evidence, the patient does not exhibit these symptoms. The reasoning for concluding URTI as the most probable diagnosis is flawed because it is based on inaccurate information. The response does not properly reference the input details, leading to an incorrect diagnostic conclusion.\n\nThe reasoning lacks clarity and accuracy due to apparent misunderstandings or misinterpretations of the input data. Specifically, details from the evidence are ignored or altered, which is critical for medical experts when evaluating the response.\n\nOverall, the response is not explainable due to the incorrect interpretation and application of the provided input data. An accurate and transparent presentation of the reasoning process is essential, especially for a medical expert audience, to ensure guidance is based on accurate patient data.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
