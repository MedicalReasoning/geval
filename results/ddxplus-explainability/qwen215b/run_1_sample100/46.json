Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 47\\nSex: F\\nDo you regularly take stimulant drugs?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever felt like you were suffocating for a very short time associated with inability to breathe or speak?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hard time opening/raising one or both eyelids?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you suddenly have difficulty or an inability to open your mouth or have jaw pain when opening it?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute dystonic reactions'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 47-year-old female who is not regularly taking stimulant drugs and has a history of fainting but no hard eyelid problems, no travel, and no sudden mouth opening difficulties.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Rare.

Additionally, the reference to \"a history of fainting\" is not present in the input data, leading to potential confusion. The lack of well-structured, persuasive, and transparent reasoning makes it difficult for a medical expert to follow or trust the information presented.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
