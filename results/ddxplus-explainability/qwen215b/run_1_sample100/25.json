Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 50\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\n    - sickening\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - hypochondrium(R)\\n    - hypochondrium(L)\\n    - belly\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - upper chest\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hiatal hernia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had stools that were black (like coal)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that get worse after eating?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N', 'options': '- GERD\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Anemia\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 50-year-old male with a burning sensation that starts in his stomach and goes up into his throat, with a bitter taste in the mouth.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE is confusing and lacks clarity on several points, which makes it not ideal for medical experts. Firstly, the response contains a significant error right from the beginning as it includes an incorrect summary of the patient's symptoms. It states that the patient has a burning sensation in their stomach that goes up into the throat with a bitter taste, which directly contradicts the input evidence where the patient negates experiencing these symptoms. Additionally, it presents an analysis of various options, but the explanation for each one is brief and not sufficiently informative for a medical expert. The response also concludes with a diagnosis of Pericarditis without providing proper justification or correlation to the patientâ€™s symptoms and evidence provided. Clarity, accuracy, and an exact match of initial symptoms are crucial for persuading medical experts which are not met in the response.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
