Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 41\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a cramp\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\n    - hypochondrium(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are (or were) choking or suffocating?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with depression?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from chronic anxiety?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel lightheaded and dizzy or do you feel like you are about to faint?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a migraine or is a member of your family known to have migraines?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are dying or were you afraid that you were about do die?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had numbness, loss of sensation or tingling, in both arms and legs and around your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are detached from your own body or your surroundings?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a head trauma?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Panic attack\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Anemia\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Stable angina\\n- GERD\\n- Inguinal hernia\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- SLE\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe patient is a 41-year-old male with chest pain, especially on the side and lower chest, described as a cramp-like pain, not radiating, not intense, not radiating, barely noticeable when seated, not affecting breath, not fainting, no headache, no numbness, no dizziness, no past history of migraines, no family history of migraines, no history of asthma or bronchodilator use, no recent travel, no previous head trauma, no recent medications, no recent exercise or strenuous activity, no symptoms of Scombroid food poisoning.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and accurate reasoning in multiple areas:\n\n1. **Incorrect Representation of Data**: The response indicates that the pain is \"not intense,\" which directly contradicts the INPUT where the pain intensity is rated as 7/10. This creates confusion and misrepresents the patient's symptoms, leading to potential misdiagnosis.\n\n2. **Redundancy and Repetition**: The response repeats \"not radiating, not intense, not radiating\" multiple times, which seems like an error and does not add clarity. Such repetition without adding new information detracts from the overall clarity and effectiveness of the response.\n\n3. **Lacking Justification**: The response concludes with a focus on possible NSTEMI/STEMI without adequately justifying why this condition is the most likely, given the absence of symptoms more specifically associated with cardiac events (e.g., radiation of pain, history of coronary disease).\n\n4. **Missing Comprehensive Analysis**: The response does not adequately analyze other possible conditions from the list provided, nor does it explain why these are ruled out, particularly why panic attack, the labeled condition, is not even considered when relevant symptoms like chest pain could have a psychological origin, especially with a high pain rating and no other comorbidities noted.\n\nOverall, the response fails to adequately explain and justify its reasoning in a manner suitable for medical experts, as requested by the criterion.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
