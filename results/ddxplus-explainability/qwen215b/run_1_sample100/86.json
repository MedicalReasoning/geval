Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 57\\nSex: F\\nHave you been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known heart defect?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating very irregularly or in a disorganized pattern?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that are increased with physical exertion but alleviated with rest?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Atrial fibrillation\\n- PSVT\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Panic attack\\n- Anemia\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 57-year-old female without known heart valve issues, COPD, or previous heart issues, who experienced shortness of breath and slight dizziness.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Several issues are present:\n\n1. **Misrepresentation of Input**: The response inaccurately claims the patient experienced shortness of breath and slight dizziness when the input states otherwise. This misinterpretation raises concerns about the reliability of the analysis.\n\n2. **Confused Reasoning**: The explanation for Atrial fibrillation states it's \"Not commonly associated with shortness of breath,\" but it is indeed associated with cardiac symptoms such as irregular heartbeats which are symptoms provided in the options list.\n\n3. **Incorrect Disease Descriptions**: The description for PSVT incorrectly expands the acronym and provides confusing information unrelated to standard medical terminology.\n\n4. **Lack of Justification**: There is little to no justification or detailed reasoning provided as to why certain conditions are ruled out or why 'Panic attack' is considered the most likely diagnosis.\n\n5. **Omission of Details**: Conditions such as anemia and myasthenia gravis are brushed aside with vague or irrelevant comments not connected to the patient's details.\n\nIn summary, the response is vague and simplistic, failing to provide a coherent, structured, and medically sound explanation, making it difficult for medical experts to follow.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
