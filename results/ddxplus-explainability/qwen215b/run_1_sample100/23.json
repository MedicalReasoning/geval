Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 87\\nSex: M\\nAre you currently taking or have you recently taken anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - heavy\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - ankle(L)\\n    - thigh(L)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(R)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(L)\\n    - sole(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have heart failure?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have liver cirrhosis?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had surgery to remove lymph nodes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have swelling in one or more areas of your body?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - ankle(R)\\n    - thigh(L)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(R)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(L)\\n    - sole(R)\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Localized edema\\n- Chagas\\n- Anaphylaxis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nAn 87-year-old male presenting with knee and thigh pain, which \"seems to come on suddenly.\" Pain is described as heavy, tedious, and sharp.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately summarize the provided evidence. It incorrectly states that the patient presents with knee and thigh pain, while the evidence specifies pain located at the ankle, thigh, dorsal aspect of the foot, and sole. Moreover, it mentions knee pain which is not in the evidence. It also concludes with Chagas as a probable diagnosis despite acknowledging that typical symptoms are not present, which is contradictory. The reasoning lacks clarity and justification, making it difficult for a medical expert to follow. The provided information also fails to appropriately address the option of localized edema which would align with swelling symptoms described in the evidence. Therefore, the response lacks clear, informative, and persuasive communication, judged on the criterion for explainability.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
