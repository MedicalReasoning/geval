Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 28\\nSex: F\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - forehead\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Influenza\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 28-year-old female with a sore throat, diffuse muscle pain, nasal congestion, and a cough without cough producing colored or more abundant sputum. \n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- URTI: Commonly presents with fever and cold symptoms.\n\n- Bronchitis: Common in smokers and has symptoms of cough and sore throat.\n\n- Pneumonia: Presents with fever, cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath.\n\n- Influenza: Viral infection, typically presenting with fever and body aches.\n\n- Cluster headache: Sharp, severe, and frequent pain.\n\n- Bronchiectasis: Chronic cough and prolonged effort produces sputum.\n\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis: Chronic inflamed sinusitis.\n\n- Acute rhinosinusitis: Inflammation of the nasal passages.\n\n- Chagas: Anemia and heart failure.\n\n- Anemia: Red blood cell count below normal.\n\nNotably, the symptoms suggest a viral infection, which fits best with URTI.\n\n```URTI```\n\nLABEL:\nURTI\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not accurately represent the information given in the INPUT. Firstly, the initial response mentions symptoms such as sore throat, diffuse muscle pain, nasal congestion, and cough, none of which are actually indicated in the INPUT. This misrepresentation of data leads to incorrect analysis and conclusion. The response lacks clarity and does not provide sufficient context or justification for the claims and reasoning presented, making it difficult for medical experts to understand or trust the information. The conclusion about URTI seems to be based on erroneous symptom matching rather than a logical analysis of the provided data.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
