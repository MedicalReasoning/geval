Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 20\\nSex: M\\nHave any of your family members been diagnosed with cluster headaches?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - tugging\\n    - violent\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - eye(L)\\n    - temple(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you feel that your eyes produce excessive tears?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Cluster headache\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 20-year-old male with no family history of cluster headaches or pain related to his reason for consultation.

    "prediction": "The initial response does provide some insights into the reasoning process leading to the conclusion of a cluster headache. However, there are issues with clarity and explainability:\n\n1. The response starts with the statement \"with no family history of cluster headaches or pain related to his reason for consultation\", which is a bit unclear since pain is indeed part of the reason for consultation.\n2. It identifies pain characteristics, but doesn't explain the relevance or typical association of such characteristics with any of the conditions listed.\n3. The analysis of the options is too brief and lacks depth. For example, it mentions \"Cluster headache: malignant, persistent, and self-limiting\" but does not explain what these terms mean or how they relate to the symptoms provided. \n4. The mention of \"Chagas\" and \"Anemia\" lacks connection between symptoms and the likelihood of diagnosis. It dismisses Chagas as \"rare in young adult males\" without explanation or evidence and does not align the information provided with anemia's typical symptoms.\n5. It concludes that the most likely diagnosis is \"Cluster headache\" without making it explicitly clear why this aligns best with the provided symptoms.\n\nOverall, the response lacks a clear step-by-step explanation connecting specific symptoms to the most likely diagnoses. This makes it challenging for medical experts to follow or trust the reasoning process.\n\nPREDICTION: ```PREDICTION```No```"
