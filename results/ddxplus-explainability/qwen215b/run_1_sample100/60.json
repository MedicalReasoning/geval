Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 56\\nSex: F\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Larygospasm'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 56-year-old woman who has a high-pitched sound when breathing in and has not traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks. She is not exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- Larygospasm: Sound when breathing in, but not high-pitched.\n\n- Asthma: Common cause, but no mention of symptoms.\n\n- Bronchiectasis: Chronic inflammation, but no symptoms given.\n\n- Croup: Sound when breathing in, but not high-pitched.\n\n- Vocal cord paralysis: High-pitched sound, but not mentioned.\n\n- Tracheal cartilage cleft: High-pitched sound, but not mentioned.\n\n- Laryngitis: High-pitched sound when breathing in, but not mentioned.\n\n- Bronchitis: Common cause, but not high-pitched.\n\n- Tonsillitis: Common cause, but not mentioned.\n\n- Nasal polyps: High-pitched sound when breathing in, but not mentioned.\n\n- Laryngomalacia: High-pitched sound, but not mentioned.\n\n- Vocal cord obstruction: High-pitched sound when breathing in, but not mentioned.\n\n- Laryngopharyngitis: Common cause, but not high-pitched.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is Larygospasm.\n\n```Larygospasm```\n\nLABEL:\nLarygospasm\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and accuracy in several areas.\n\nFirstly, it incorrectly states that the patient has a high-pitched sound when breathing in, while the INPUT indicates the opposite. This error significantly undermines the explainability of the response as it suggests faulty reasoning right from the start.\n\nSecondly, it proceeds with brief, somewhat misleading analyses of other conditions, where it notes features like 'high-pitched sound' based purely on incorrect premises rather than evidence in the INPUT, which emphasized 'no high-pitched sound'. This misinformation does not adequately justify the stated conclusion of Larygospasm.\n\nOverall, the response is neither clear nor logically constructed, resulting in a misleading output where a medical expert could find it difficult to interpret and trust.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
