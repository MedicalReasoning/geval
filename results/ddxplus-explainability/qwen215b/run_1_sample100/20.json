Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 51\\nSex: M\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - pharynx\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- URTI\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 51-year-old male with no past history of similar symptoms, not attending or working in a daycare, no pain that relates to his reason for consultation, no tonsillitis, no thyroid cartilage, no pharynx pain, no pain radiating to another location, no precise pain location, no pain appearing suddenly, no smoking, no nasal congestion or clear runny nose, no cough, no travel in the last 4 weeks.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nViral pharyngitis: No tonsillitis or throat pain, fits poorly.\n\nBronchitis: No pharynx, fits poorly.\n\nAcute laryngitis: No tonsillitis or throat pain.\n\nURTIs: Fits poorly.\n\nPossible NSTEMI / STEMI: Fits poorly.\n\nUnstable angina: Fits poorly.\n\nStable angina: No symptoms.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is Viral pharyngitis.\n\n```Viral pharyngitis```\n\nLABEL:\nViral pharyngitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inaccuracies and inconsistencies which hinder its explainability. \n\n1. The response incorrectly states \"no past history of similar symptoms, not attending or working in a daycare, no pain that relates to his reason for consultation\", which contradicts the input where it mentions the patient feels pain in specific areas such as tonsil (L), thyroid cartilage, and pharynx, and has an intense pain level of 8.\n\n2. The INITIAL RESPONSE also claims \"no tonsillitis, no thyroid cartilage, no pharynx pain,\" which is incorrect since the input clearly states pain is felt in these areas. \n\n3. It further concludes with \"The most probable diagnosis is Viral pharyngitis\" despite stating \"fits poorly\" for Viral pharyngitis in the analyses.\n\nThese inconsistencies suggest a failure in logical reasoning, inaccurate interpretation of data, and poor transparency in reaching the conclusion. Consequently, the INITIAL RESPONSE is unclear and fails to provide a clear, informative, and persuasive explanation that medical experts would expect.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
