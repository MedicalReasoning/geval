Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 39\\nSex: F\\nDo you feel anxious?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a cramp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - flank(R)\\n    - flank(L)\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\n    - iliac fossa(L)\\n    - hypochondrium(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you feel like you are (or were) choking or suffocating?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from chronic anxiety?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel lightheaded and dizzy or do you feel like you are about to faint?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a migraine or is a member of your family known to have migraines?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are dying or were you afraid that you were about do die?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from fibromyalgia?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are detached from your own body or your surroundings?\\n    - N\\nDo you currently, or did you ever, have numbness, loss of sensitivity or tingling anywhere on your body?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Panic attack\\n- PSVT\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- GERD\\n- Inguinal hernia\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 39-year-old female with an intermittent, sharp pain in the flank and difficulty breathing.

    "prediction": "To evaluate the INITIAL RESPONSE for explainability, we have to assess how clearly, informatively, and persuasively it conveys complex medical information to medical experts.\n\n1. **Clarity and Accuracy**: The response contains inaccuracies and lacks clarity:\n   - It mentions \"difficulty breathing,\" which isn't supported by the provided evidence where the individual does not express choking or suffocating (\"- N\").\n   - Uses terms like \"pandyning,\" which could be a typographical error and isn't a recognized term in this context.\n   - The response explains each possible condition, but the rationale for ruling them out is weak or not fully informed by the evidence provided, as is the case for \"Panic attack\" which was chosen based on incomplete justification.\n\n2. **Informative and Well-structured**: The structure follows a logical path by addressing each option provided, but the rationale behind excluding each condition is not sufficiently explained or aligned with the evidence:\n   - It fails to provide adequate justification for why a \"Panic attack\" is concluded as the most likely diagnosis, especially since the specific symptoms important for this diagnosis are not thoroughly discussed or matched to the input.\n\n3. **Persuasiveness**: The explanation is not persuasive because it makes conclusions without sufficient explanations. For example, several conclusions (e.g., \"Guillain-Barré syndrome: Not common and does not fit the pain\") are based on vague statements rather than evidence-based reasoning.\n\nBased on these observations, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
