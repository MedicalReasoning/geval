Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nExplainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?\nThe initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 24\\nSex: F\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Larygospasm'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 24-year-old female with no history of asthma or bronchodilator use.

    "prediction": "1. The INITIAL RESPONSE begins by summarizing the evidence provided in the INPUT, stating the patient's age, gender, and lack of certain medical conditions or exposures. This summary is clear and concise.\n\n2. The response then moves on to analyze the options, mentioning one condition, \"Larygospasm,\" and briefly noting that it is usually seen in smoking patients. However, there is a lack of explanation or reasoning as to why this diagnosis is considered relevant, especially since the patient is not exposed to secondhand smoke.\n\n3. The INITIAL RESPONSE concludes by proposing an entirely different diagnosis, \"Oropharyngeal (Laryngopharyngeal) dysphagia,\" without any explanation for this conclusion. The sudden shift in diagnosis is not justified by the evidence or supported by any explanation.\n\n4. The response fails to provide adequate context or justification for its conclusions and does not offer a logical reasoning process for either the consideration of laryngospasm or the final suggestion of oropharyngeal dysphagia. \n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanation for its final diagnosis, making it difficult for medical experts to understand the reasoning process and trust the information provided. \n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
