Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inaccuracies when compared to the patient data from the INPUT. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Chest Pain Description**: The response says the pain is \"not intense\" and \"barely noticeable,\" while the INPUT clearly lists the pain intensity as 7 out of 10, which indicates a moderately high level of pain.\n\n2. **Radiation of Pain**: The response wrongly repeats that the pain is \"not radiating\" when the INPUT doesn't say otherwise. Thus, while correct on the non-radiation aspect, it still repeats itself unnecessarily.\n\n3. **Symptom Summary**: The response refers to symptoms not present in the INPUT such as \"barely noticeable when seated,\" headaches, and a list of \"No headaches, no numbness...\" which are not in the symptoms checked in the INPUT.\n\n4. **Condition Deduction**: The response suggests \"possible NSTEMI/STEMI\" without directly justifying this from a symptom-driven context. There is chest pain, but many conditions in the options list could lead to chest pain, and the case for NSTEMI/STEMI is not built well in the context of symptoms (which do not include any heart problem-specific symptoms like those suggesting nausea, sweat, or extreme distress which often accompany heart problems).\n\n5. **Option Analysis**: Lastly, the model in the response arrives incorrectly at a condition based on aligning symptoms inadequately to match conditions instead of analyzing brief symptoms to potentially categorically exclude any.\n\n6. **Predictive Label Misalignment**: While the respone gravitates towards NSTEMI/STEMI, the correct label is \"Panic attack,\" showing a disconnect in contextual interpretation as several conditions like \"difficulty breathing, feeling of dying\" are directly related to panic attack which was not mentioned or ruled on accurately.\n\nIn essence, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks accuracy and does not align with the INPUT scenario correctly. Thus, it should not be considered contextually accurate.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
