Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 26\\nSex: M\\nIs your nose or the back of your throat itchy?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe itching in one or both eyes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live in in a big city?\\n    - N\\nAre you more likely to develop common allergies than the general population?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Allergic sinusitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Influenza'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe given information suggests a patient with no symptoms of common allergies, traveling less than 4 weeks, and living in a non-big city. This indicates a less likely case of Influenza (the common cold).\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAllergic sinusitis: Common in people with allergies and travel history.\n\nBronchitis: Common in smokers.\n\nURTI: Often includes cough, fever, and facial flushing, but not all.\n\nInfluenza: A common cold.\n\nBased on the given information, the most likely diagnosis is Bronchitis.\n\n```Bronchitis```\n\nLABEL:\nAllergic sinusitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not accurately address the context provided in the INPUT. The response incorrectly interprets the information given. The logic applied to the options is flawed:\n\n1. The response claims that Influenza is a \"common cold,\" which is a misconception. Influenza is a different virus and condition compared to the common cold.\n2. There is no mention in the evidences of the patient being a smoker or having a history of smoking, yet the response dismisses bronchitis due to smoking habits rather than based on symptoms or evidence.\n3. The response incorrectly concludes the most likely diagnosis is Bronchitis despite the negative responses for symptoms typically associated with Bronchitis such as cough.\n4. Moreover, the understanding of \"Allergic sinusitis\" requiring travel history is misplaced; travel is not a typical diagnostic criterion for allergic sinusitis.\n\nThe INITIAL RESPONSE fails in contextual accuracy by making assumptions not supported by the symptoms nor the context provided in the INPUT. Hence, the final prediction is not aligned with the evidence, which labels the diagnosis as \"Allergic sinusitis.\"\n\nTherefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not align well with the criteria.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
