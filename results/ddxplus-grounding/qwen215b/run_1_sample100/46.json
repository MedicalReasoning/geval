Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 47\\nSex: F\\nDo you regularly take stimulant drugs?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever felt like you were suffocating for a very short time associated with inability to breathe or speak?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hard time opening/raising one or both eyelids?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you suddenly have difficulty or an inability to open your mouth or have jaw pain when opening it?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute dystonic reactions'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 47-year-old female who is not regularly taking stimulant drugs and has a history of fainting but no hard eyelid problems, no travel, and no sudden mouth opening difficulties.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Rare.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE lacks contextual accuracy given the INPUT. Here's why:\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of Input Details**: The input does not mention any history of fainting, yet the INITIAL RESPONSE refers to a history of fainting, indicating a misinterpretation or assumption not supported by the input data.\n\n2. **Generic Reasoning**: The reasoning provided is somewhat generic and not deeply tied to the specifics of the input. The response does mention that the acute dystonic reactions are rare and minimally connected to stimulant use, but does not elaborate on how this diagnosis aligns with the specific symptoms (or lack of symptoms) as provided in the input.\n\n3. **Overlooking Key Details**: The INITIAL RESPONSE does not address or incorporate several key elements from the analyzed input that could be critical to a contextual diagnosis, such as the absence of eyelid problems, jaw issues, or other symptoms like suffocation sensations.\n\nTherefore, due to these disconnects between the input and the response, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not meet the criterion of contextual accuracy.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
