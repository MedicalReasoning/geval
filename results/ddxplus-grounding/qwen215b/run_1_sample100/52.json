Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context provided in the INPUT. Several critical details are overlooked or misinterpreted:\n\n1. The patient does report severe, intense pain that is rated at 10/10 and is located in multiple areas, including the chest and epigastric region, which should have been taken into account when considering the potential options for diagnosis.\n2. The response incorrectly states that the patient reports no pain, which is a critical oversight since the INPUT indicates significant pain is present. \n3. The reasoning for ruling out conditions such as GERD and panic attacks due to age is misguided, as these conditions can indeed occur in the given age group. Furthermore, some assertions about the rarity of conditions are not justified or relevant to the presented symptoms. \n4. Finally, the response inaccurately concludes that Sarcoidosis is the most likely diagnosis without fairly assessing other possibilities like GERD or even NSTEMI/STEMI in the context of her symptoms. This does not align well with the specific details given, such as the pain severity and characteristics.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks a tailored analysis of the patient symptoms, disregards critical details, and misinterprets the context of the patient's symptoms against the provided medical history and options. Therefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not meet the criterion for Contextual Accuracy.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
