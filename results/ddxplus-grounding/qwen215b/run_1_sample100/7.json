Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 55\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - palace\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 55-year-old female with no history of similar symptoms in the last 2 weeks, living alone, attending a daycare, mild pain in her tonsils (tonsil(R) or tonsil(L)), and a burning pain localized to her jaw.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not accurately align with the specific context provided in the INPUT. There are several contextual inaccuracies:\n\n1. The INPUT indicates that the patient does not attend or work in a daycare, which contradicts the INITIAL RESPONSE mentioning \"attending a daycare.\"\n2. The INITIAL RESPONSE misinterprets URTI as \"Urinary tract infection,\" whereas URTI stands for \"Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,\" which is relevant to the context of pharyngitis.\n3. The conclusion of \"Stable angina\" as the most probable diagnosis is unsupported given the symptoms in the INPUT primarily focus on throat and jaw pain without any mention of symptoms typically associated with angina such as chest pain or related cardiac symptoms.\n4. The INITIAL RESPONSE overlooks \"Viral pharyngitis,\" which is a more plausible diagnosis given the symptoms related to tonsil and throat pain.\n\nFurthermore, the reasoning lacks depth and fails to effectively incorporate the context details, such as the burning sensation and its likely viral nature based on the absence of travel and contact with sick individuals.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
