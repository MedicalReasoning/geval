Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly summarizes the findings from the INPUT and also makes an incorrect conclusion on the potential diagnosis. The summary erroneously states \"pain (a knife stroke) in the right breast (L)\" when the INPUT clearly states pain in \"lower chest,\" \"upper chest,\" and \"breast(L)\" - and fails to note that the pain intensity is 4. It also indicates that the pain is \"not radiating, not precise,\" when the precision was rated as 5. Furthermore, the analysis of the options overlooks several relevant conditions in the context, such as myocarditis, which can present with chest pain and is actually the correct answer according to the LABEL. The reasoning provided does not take into account the full set of symptoms and instead focuses on disparities that do not align with the INPUT details. Such discrepancies lead to a conclusion that does not appropriately consider myocarditis, which would likely need consideration given the age and symptoms presented. The initial response diagnosis of a panic attack is inadequate, failing to contextually address the symptoms such as the knife-like chest pain that would be unusual for a panic attack.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
