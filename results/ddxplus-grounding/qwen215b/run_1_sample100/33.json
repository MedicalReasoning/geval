Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 1\\nSex: M\\nAre you currently being treated or have you recently been treated with an oral antibiotic for an ear infection?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - ear(R)\\n    - ear(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nAre you more irritable or has your mood been very unstable recently?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Acute otitis media\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe patient is a 1-year-old male with an ear infection. He is not currently being treated or recently treated with an oral antibiotic for an ear infection. He does not have pain related to his reason for consulting, but he has pain in his ear(R). The pain is described as sensitive, and it has been observed here. The intensity is rated as 9/10. The pain does not radiate to another location, and it is not very precise. The pain began 4 weeks ago, and the patient is not irritable or has a very unstable mood. No fever was felt or measured with a thermometer. There is no cough.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- Bronchitis: Not typical for a one-year-old.\n\n- Acute otitis media: Common in young children, but not typically in a one-year-old.\n\n- Pneumonia: Common in older children and adults.\n\n- Tuberculosis: Less common in young children.\n\n- Chagas: Not typically seen in the United States.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is Acute otitis media.\n\n```Acute otitis media```\n\nLABEL:\nAcute otitis media\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE is not contextually accurate based on the INPUT provided. The response contains multiple errors and inconsistent interpretations of the evidence:\n\n1. The response incorrectly states \"the patient is a 1-year-old male with an ear infection,\" while the INPUT specifies that the patient is not currently being treated for an ear infection and does not have pain related to the reason for consulting. \n2. The pain is characterized as both \"sensitive\" and \"sharp,\" located in both ears with an intensity of 9/10, which the response fails to recognize correctly. \n3. The interpretation of symptoms and options is flawed. For example, the response implies \"Acute otitis media\" is not common in young children, which contradicts common medical knowledge that otitis media is indeed common in this age group.\n4. The time frame \"began 4 weeks ago\" is mentioned, but this does not accurately represent the \"How fast did the pain appear?\" question, which is a different metric.\n\nThese inaccuracies indicate a failure to align the response appropriately with the context and nuances of the INPUT. Consequently, the INITIAL RESPONSE seems generic and overlooks crucial details. \n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
