Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE is contextually inaccurate. \n\nThe patient, as per the INPUT, is a 19-year-old male who is not coughing up blood, which contradicts the statement made in the initial response that describes the patient as coughing up blood. Additionally, the focus on coughing up blood throughout the analysis is irrelevant because the patient does not exhibit this symptom. Moreover, the conclusion that acute dystonic reactions are the most probable diagnosis does not incorporate the full context of the patient's symptoms, such as chest pain and its characteristics, intensity, and the lack of breathing difficulty. The context of the pain's location, intensity, and speed of onset are crucial diagnostic aspects that were overlooked. The provided LABEL \"Pulmonary embolism\" might align with the patient's symptom profile more than \"Acute dystonic reactions,\" yet this was not considered in the response. Therefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates a lack of accuracy concerning the provided patient details and medical context.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
