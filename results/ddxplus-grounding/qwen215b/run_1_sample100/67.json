Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 80\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Influenza\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Boerhaave\\n- GERD\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Chagas\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think through this step-by-step. \n\n- The patient is a 80-year-old woman with pain on the side of the chest (R) and feeling of burning.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE evaluates the symptoms described for an 80-year-old female patient. However, it incorrectly states that the patient feels pain only on the side of the chest and omits other reported locations such as the upper chest and breast (L). Furthermore, it describes the pain intensity as \"extremely intense\" (rated 5), which may not align with typical clinical descriptions, and incorrectly interprets the \"time of appearance\" value as \"occurred 2 days ago,\" rather than referring to the speed at which the pain appeared. It also makes an unsupported presumption that the patient does not have a history of heart conditions or gastrointestinal issues, which is not explicitly stated in the INPUT data. Consequently, the response overlooks and misinterprets critical details and symptoms provided, leading to a \"No specific diagnosis\" label inconsistent with the existing options and the provided label \"Bronchitis.\"\n\nTherefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to align accurately and appropriately with the specific context and nuances provided, leading to a failure in contextual accuracy.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
