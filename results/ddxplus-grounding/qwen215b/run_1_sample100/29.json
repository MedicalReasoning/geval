Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE is not contextually accurate. There are several issues in the response:\n\n1. Misinterpretation of the input: The response incorrectly mentions the patient as having \"coughing up blood,\" which is contrary to the input where it is explicitly noted that the patient does not have this symptom.\n\n2. Ignoring details: The response fails to accurately summarize the symptoms, such as the input mentioning pain in multiple locations (side of the chest, scapula, breast, posterior chest wall), despite the response suggesting the patient does not feel pain in other locations.\n\n3. Inaccurate conclusion: The conclusion suggests pulmonary embolism, which commonly presents with shortness of breath, a symptom not present in the patient according to the input. \n\nDue to these inaccuracies and misinterpretations of the described symptoms and medical history, the response demonstrates poor alignment with the specific patient details provided.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
