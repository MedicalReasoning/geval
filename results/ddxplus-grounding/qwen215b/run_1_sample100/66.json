Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE fails to properly summarize the patient's symptoms and misinterprets several key details from the INPUT. Specifically:\n\n1. **Symptoms and Location**: While the response starts by correctly noting the patient's age and lack of family history with cluster headaches, it inaccurately lists the pain as being located only on the forehead, whereas the INPUT indicates the pain is experienced on the forehead, cheek (right), eye (left), and temple (right).\n\n2. **Pain Characteristics**: The INITIAL RESPONSE lists the pain as \"a knife stroke, a tugging sensation, and sharpness,\" but omits the descriptors \"haunting,\" \"violent,\" and others that are present in the INPUT.\n\n3. **Option Analysis**: The analysis of cluster headaches is simplistic and does not take into account associated symptoms found in the INPUT or expected symptoms of cluster headaches, which often include additional symptoms like tearing and nasal congestion, both of which the patient denies.\n\n4. **Diagnosis**: While the response concludes with cluster headaches as the diagnosis, it lacks a clear justification based on the evidence provided, especially given the absence of other symptomatic features generally associated with the condition.\n\nGiven these points, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not reflect a deep understanding of the context and fails to accurately interpret the medical information provided in the INPUT.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
