Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inaccuracies compared to the INPUT. Firstly, the response incorrectly states that the patient has a sore throat, cough, and shortness of breath, whereas the INPUT clearly indicates that the patient does not experience any of these symptoms. Additionally, the response notes \"No pain in the chest, pharynx, posterior chest wall, or upper chest,\" which contradicts the INPUT, where the patient does report mild pain in these areas. These inaccuracies in interpreting the patient's symptoms relative to the provided context make the diagnosis of URTI contextually inappropriate.\n\nThe conclusions and reasoning in the INITIAL RESPONSE are not tailored to the specific details provided. For instance, the suggested likely diagnosis of URTI does not correspond well with the described symptoms, especially given the absence of a sore throat or cough. Instead, the patient reports no major respiratory symptoms, which could imply other possible diagnoses, such as GERD or stable angina—conditions known to cause chest discomfort without respiratory involvement.\n\nThus, the INITIAL RESPONSE shows a significant lack of alignment with the specific medical details provided in the INPUT, leading to an inaccurate contextual analysis.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
