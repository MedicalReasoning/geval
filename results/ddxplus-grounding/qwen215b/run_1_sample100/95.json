Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provides an assessment of possible diagnoses based on the symptoms and information provided in the INPUT. However, it misinterprets several key aspects:\n\n1. **Diabetes and Pancreatic Neoplasm**: The response incorrectly dismisses pancreatic neoplasm solely due to the absence of diabetes, while the correlation isn't direct or exclusive. Furthermore, the patient has flank and hypochondrium pain, potential indicators of pancreatic issues, which the INITIAL RESPONSE does not consider.\n\n2. **Description of Symptoms**: It claims there's no presence of \"skin lesions\" and \"rash\" in the patient's history, which contradicts the INPUT where a rash is indeed described. This showcases a clear oversight of provided details.\n\n3. **Scombroid Food Poisoning**: The rationale for selecting this diagnosis as the most probable is simplistic and lacks support from the available symptoms. Scombroid poisoning involves specific dietary history and symptom manifestation that aren't detailed in the INPUT.\n\nThe INITIAL RESPONSE inadequately aligns with the INPUT details, demonstrating omissions and misinterpretations. Thus, the Contextual Accuracy rating is No.\n\nPREDICTION: ```PREDICTION```No```"
