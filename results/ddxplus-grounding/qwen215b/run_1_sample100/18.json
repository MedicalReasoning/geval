Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor contextual accuracy for the following reasons: \n\n1. There is an error in understanding the context of the symptoms. The patient is said not to have symptoms like coughing up blood, shortness of breath, or anemia, according to the INPUT. The response inaccurately attributes these symptoms to the patient, misrepresenting their actual medical condition.\n\n2. The reasoning taken to analyze the options is not well aligned with the evidence provided. The INITIAL RESPONSE does not reflect the patient's status that lacks notable symptoms such as coughing up blood, shortness of breath or other lung disease symptoms (all marked negative in the INPUT).\n\n3. The conclusion of \"Tuberculosis\" as the most probable diagnosis overlooks the evidence, as there are no symptoms present that typically suggest tuberculosis given negative travel history, no immunosuppression, and no positive respiratory symptoms.\n\nIn summary, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately reflect the provided context, overlooks critical details from the evidence regarding symptom absence, and reaches an unsuitable conclusion not supported by the INPUT evidence.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
