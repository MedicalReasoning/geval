Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The initial response contains several inaccuracies and misinterpretations of the provided context, impacting its contextual accuracy:\n\n1. There is a misunderstanding about pain radiating, as the input explicitly states that the pain does radiate to other locations such as the back of the head, nose, and temples (R and L), which contrasts with the response that mentions the pain does not radiate.\n\n2. The analysis of conditions is inadequate. For instance:\n   - Viral pharyngitis is associated with a sore throat, but there's no mention of throat pain or sore throat in the patient's input.\n   - Cluster headaches and acute/chronic rhinosinusitis are more relevant options given the pain location and symptoms, which include areas around the eyes and forehead.\n\n3. The diagnosis of \"Viral pharyngitis\" is contextually inappropriate given the input, where no throat infection symptoms are described.\n\n4. Additionally, reference to \"URTI\" as Urinary tract infection is inaccurate when interpreted as “Upper Respiratory Tract Infection” within this context.\n\nUltimately, the response fails to align with the specific context. It misinterprets symptoms and provides a general analysis that misses vital input details. Based on the presented evidence and context, the assessment misled to \"Viral pharyngitis\" instead of the labeled \"Chronic rhinosinusitis.\"\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
