Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 26\\nSex: F\\nDo you feel your abdomen is bloated or distended (swollen due to pressure from inside)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\n    - iliac fossa(L)\\n    - hip(R)\\n    - hip(L)\\n    - testicle(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - NA\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - N\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - N\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have intense coughing fits?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Inguinal hernia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 26-year-old female with abdominal bloating and pain in the iliac fossa without any other symptoms.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not accurately capture the specific context provided in the INPUT. There are several inconsistencies:\n\n1. The response mentions \"abdominal bloating,\" but the patient explicitly answered 'No' to feeling their abdomen is bloated or distended.\n\n2. The description of pain is not entirely accurate. The patient mentions multiple locations of pain (iliac fossas, hips, and testicle) and characterizes the pain as 'heavy', but the response simplifies it to \"pain in the iliac fossa.\"\n\n3. The INITIAL RESPONSE claims there is \"no rash,\" but the INPUT specifies 0 intensity for certain aspects of rash-related symptoms, which suggests the system could interpret these parameters rather than mistakenly claim it's absent.\n\n4. The evaluation of the likelihood of potential diagnoses does not reflect the details in the INPUT: no evidence is provided to support the choice of \"Inguinal hernia\" or why the response states it as \"less likely to cause abdominal bloating\", contradicting the assertion of abdominal bloating.\n\nHence, the INITIAL RESPONSE contains inaccuracies and misinterpretations, not aligning well with the provided patient information, resulting in a poor alignment with the given medical situation.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
