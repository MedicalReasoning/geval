Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 56\\nSex: F\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Larygospasm'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 56-year-old woman who has a high-pitched sound when breathing in and has not traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE shows several inaccuracies in relation to the INPUT:\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of Symptoms**: The input specifies there is no high-pitched sound when breathing in. However, the response bases its analysis on the assumption that the patient has such a symptom, which is incorrect.\n\n2. **Ignoring Travel and Smoke Exposure Details**: While the response does include the patient's travel history and smoke exposure in its initial summary, it fails to consider these details in the logical reasoning of the diagnosis.\n\n3. **Irrelevant Examination of Options**: The response examines a long list of potential diagnoses, none of which are provided in the input options, which specify only \"Larygospasm.\" The response presented focuses on detailing why conditions that were not options are or aren't relevant, introducing irrelevant and contextually inaccurate content.\n\n4. **Conclusion Mismatch**: It concludes by suggesting \"Larygospasm\" but provides reasoning based on incorrect premises and irrelevant options, leading to a decision that doesn't match the required context properly.\n\nDue to these reasons, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not accurately and appropriately address the specific patient context given in the input.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
