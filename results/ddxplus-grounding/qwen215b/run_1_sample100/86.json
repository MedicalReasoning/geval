Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "To evaluate the INITIAL RESPONSE, let's closely analyze the INPUT and the INITIAL RESPONSE according to the criterion of Contextual Accuracy:\n\nThe INPUT provides detailed medical history and symptom information of a 57-year-old female patient who does not have a history of hyperthyroidism, heart valve issues, COPD, significant shortness of breath, dizziness, heart attacks, angina, heart defects, irregular heartbeats, recent travel, or symptoms that increase with exertion.\n\nThe INITIAL RESPONSE, however, incorrectly states that the patient \"experienced shortness of breath and slight dizziness\" and \"feels her heart beats irregularly or disorganized\", which is not consistent with the INPUT provided. Consequently, there is a disconnection between the provided patient information and the response's discussion of symptoms.\n\nFurthermore, the response's analysis and final diagnosis of a \"Panic attack\" also do not align with the provided options and disregards the correct label \"Atrial fibrillation\". The response contains inaccuracies, such as stating \"PSVT: Pectus Sternal Vibra Triae (irregular heartbeats)\" which is not a recognized medical condition, indicating misunderstanding or errors in interpreting medical terms.\n\nThus, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately understand and apply the context provided in the INPUT. Hence, according to the criterion of Contextual Accuracy, the INITIAL RESPONSE is not contextually accurate.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
