Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 73\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 73-year-old female with burning pain in the throat, tonsil, thyroid cartilage, and pharynx, located under the jaw, not radiating, and intense at 5.

It's much more consistent with viral pharyngitis. The intense, localized pain is likely to be a symptom of a viral infection.\n\n```Viral pharyngitis```\n\nLABEL:\nViral pharyngitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains a few inaccuracies when compared to the INPUT:\n\n1. **Pain Intensity**: The INPUT specifies the pain intensity as 3, but the response mentions the pain as \"intense at 5.\" This misinterpretation of the data may affect the diagnosis.\n   \n2. **Presence of Cough**: The INPUT clearly states \"Do you have a cough? - N,\" indicating no cough. However, the response inaccurately claims, \"She has a cough...\" This is a crucial discrepancy that alters the context significantly.\n\n3. **Understanding of Symptoms**: The response mentions, \"Pain in the throat is not typical for this\" under Viral Pharyngitis, which is contradictory since pharyngitis often presents with a sore throat.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Because the initial reasoning had inaccuracies in symptom interpretation and the final diagnosis of viral pharyngitis does not align with the presented reasoning, the contextual accuracy of the response is compromised.\n\nGiven these issues, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not perfectly align with the INPUT, misinterpreting and misrepresenting key patient details. Therefore, the response does not demonstrate a deep understanding of the context provided.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
