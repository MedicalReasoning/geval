Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 10\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - tugging\\n    - burning\\n    - sickening\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - hypochondrium(L)\\n    - belly\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - lower chest\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hiatal hernia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you think you are pregnant or are you currently pregnant?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently thrown up blood or something resembling coffee beans?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that get worse after eating?\\n    - N', 'options': '- GERD'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 10-year-old female with a sensitive, a knife stroke, and a burning sensation that starts in the stomach and goes up into the throat.

The INPUT provides information about the symptoms and personal details of a 10-year-old female patient and lists GERD as the possible diagnosis.\n\nUpon reviewing the INITIAL RESPONSE:\n\n1. The response incorrectly states that the patient has \"a burning sensation that starts in the stomach and goes up into the throat.\" However, the INPUT specifies that the patient does not have this symptom.\n2. The analysis provided in the response lacks coherence and inaccurately repeats GERD and unrelated conditions (Asthma, Hiatal Hernia) without focus.\n3. The assessment incorrectly suggests \"Burning sensation (GERD)\" as the most likely diagnosis, despite the lack of supporting symptoms as per the INPUT provided.\n\nTherefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to provide an accurate and contextually appropriate analysis of the INPUT details about the patient and the symptoms, thereby not aligning well with the criterion.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
