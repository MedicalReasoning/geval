Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE inaccurately interprets the symptoms presented in the INPUT. Specifically, the response suggests that the most likely diagnosis is \"Acute dystonic reactions,\" which is not supported by the evidence provided. The pain described in the INPUT does not match typical symptoms of acute dystonic reactions, which usually involve muscle contractions or spasms, not chest pain. Furthermore, some interpretations in the initial response are incorrect, such as stating that \"Pericarditis\" is a rare cause of severe upper chest pain, when it should be considered given the pain characteristics and options. Important details such as the type of pain, its sudden onset, and its specific characteristics should have been analyzed more accurately, considering \"Pericarditis\" as a possibility. Overall, the INITIAL RESPONSE misinterprets the context heavily and misses the nuances of the symptoms.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
