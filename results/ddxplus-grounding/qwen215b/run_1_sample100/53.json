Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE inaccurately considers and summarizes the pertinent medical information provided in the INPUT regarding the patient's symptoms. The description of the chest pain as \"not severe\" is incorrect as the pain intensity is rated at ten, which signifies severe pain. Additionally, the analysis of \"Spontaneous rib fracture\" as an option is largely overlooked, thereby failing to correlate the symptoms of sharp, intense chest pain with rib fracture. \"Bronchitis\" was identified as the most likely diagnosis, despite a lack of alignment with the symptomatology of sharp pain. Consequently, the conclusion fails to accurately align with the context, misrepresents the severity of the pain, and overlooks the correct label as being more relevant.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
