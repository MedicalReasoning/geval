Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The response inaccurately assesses the provided context and fails to make a logical conclusion based on the medical information presented. Here's why:\n\n1. **Symptoms**: The input describes a 4-year-old boy experiencing pain on both sides of the chest and shoulder area, specifically indicating sharp and sensitive pain without radiation and additional symptoms such as shortness of breath being absent.\n\n2. **Options**: Given the symptoms, the response incorrectly dismisses pulmonary embolism based on the absence of shortness of breath, even though pulmonary embolism can still present with chest pain especially if other causes are unlikely given the age and symptom severity.\n\n3. **Misinterpretation**: The response also incorrectly states the options' characteristic symptoms and matches them poorly to the presented case, potentially misguiding the diagnosis without sufficient justification for ruling out/considering the options expertly.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The chosen diagnosis, \"Acute dystonic reactions,\" is reliant on poorly interpreted symptoms like muscle pain being misaligned with chest pain and lacks coherent linkage to the core symptoms provided in the input.\n\nThe conclusion overlooks the context and fails to align accurately with the scenario described, lacking depth in reasoning relative to the patient details. According to the guideline, the outcome does not satisfy contextual accuracy criteria.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
