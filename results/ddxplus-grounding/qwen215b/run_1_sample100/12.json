Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE inaccurately describes the symptoms of the patient. The patient does not report \"coughing up blood\" or \"shortness of breath,\" contrary to what the response suggests. This shows a clear misinterpretation of the INPUT data. Furthermore, the conclusion that \"Acute pulmonary edema\" is the most probable diagnosis does not align with the symptoms provided, particularly since the patient explicitly denies significant breathing difficulties, which are central to a diagnosis of pulmonary edema. Overall, the response fails to accurately address the context of the patient's condition and symptoms provided in the INPUT. \n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
