Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "In evaluating the INITIAL RESPONSE, it seems there is a misalignment with the given context. The provided evidence does not support a diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis, as the patient's responses are all negative regarding symptoms or recent medical treatments that could relate to either acute dystonic reactions or Myasthenia Gravis. The conclusion drawn in the INITIAL RESPONSE appears to have been reached without sufficient rationale connecting the evidence presented to Myasthenia Gravis. The conclusion should have instead justified its reasoning based on the specific symptoms or lack thereof and the patient's medical history. Thus, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to adequately and contextually address the input data's requirements, resulting in an inaccurate alignment with the given situation.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
