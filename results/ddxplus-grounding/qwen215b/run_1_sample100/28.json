Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 10\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you immunosuppressed?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Influenza\\n- Pneumonia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 10-year-old girl with sore throat, cough, tonsil pain, and no fever.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE inaccurately reflects the context from the INPUT. Specifically, there are several inaccuracies:\n\n1. The patient does not have a cough, as noted in the INPUT (\"Do you have a cough? - N\"), yet the INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly mentions \"sore throat, cough.\"\n2. There is no reference made to the fact that the patient \"does not have a fever\" directly from the symptoms listed, which should be clearly considered in the differential diagnosis.\n3. The response states, \"Analyzing the options: Bronchitis is common in adults,\" which seems out of context considering the patient is a 10-year-old child.\n4. The conclusion of \"Viral pharyngitis\" should be more substantiated by linking specifically to symptoms listed â€” notably, the lack of fever and specific throat pain mentioned is crucial here.\n\nBecause of these interpretation errors and oversight of key patient details that misguide the analysis, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks adequate contextual accuracy to the given INPUT.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
