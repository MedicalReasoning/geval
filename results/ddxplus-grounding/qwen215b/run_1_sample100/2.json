Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provided suggests \"Anemia\" as the most probable diagnosis based on the given context. However, the context provided indicates the patient has no history of anemia, no family history of anemia, and does not experience symptoms typically associated with anemia, such as fatigue or shortness of breath. Furthermore, the pain characteristics noted (e.g., location, intensity) and the lack of significant symptoms do not strongly align with anemia. The response fails to adequately incorporate details from the input and overlooks the potential alignment with other diagnostic options such as \"Cluster headache,\" given the described pain characteristics (e.g., location at the back of head, forehead, and right temple). The reasoning in the response appears to misinterpret the context, leading to a diagnosis that does not fit well with the provided information. Thus, the INITIAL RESPONSE is not contextually accurate.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
