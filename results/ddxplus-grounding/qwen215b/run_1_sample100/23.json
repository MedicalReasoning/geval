Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "1. An 87-year-old male with various pain locations and swelling discrepancies is described in the INPUT. The pain is noted at multiple locations, including the left ankle, left thigh, dorsal aspect of both feet, and the right sole. There is also swelling at the right ankle, left thigh, and both dorsal aspects of the feet along with the right sole. The pain level is intense, rated 6 out of 10, and the swelling is specified but not localized to the knee.\n\n2. The INITIAL RESPONSE describes knee and thigh pain, which is incorrect as the INPUT doesn't mention knee pain, and misrepresents the pain localization by omitting information about the foot and ankle. The response incorrectly states the pain is \"precise\" while the INPUT notes precise location at 7. The response ignores other specified symptoms and inaccurately excludes relevant edema talk. Additionally, the reasoning incorrectly emphasizes knee pain and misidentifies Chagas disease, as it is uncommon and unlikely linked to observed symptoms in context, particularly as the INPUT specifies swelling (localized edema) making it more relevant to consider.\n\n3. The contextual conclusion should involve choosing Localized Edema according to INPUT symptom data. The INITIAL RESPONSE doesn't align accurately with the INPUT in several respects, including neglecting the correct symptoms and incorrectly identifying Chagas as the diagnosis.\n\nPREDICTION: ```PREDICTION```No```"
