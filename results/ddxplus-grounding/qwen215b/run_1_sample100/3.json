Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "In the given INITIAL RESPONSE, the pain description is mischaracterized with the response stating, \"Pain is not 'sensitive,'\" which contradicts the input describing the pain character as sensitive. Furthermore, the response incorrectly states the presence of influenza symptoms (headache, fever, and cough) while the input indicates no cough or fever. The options list provided in the INPUT is also not accurately reflected, with the response incorrectly stating that several options (Pneumonia, Bronchitis, Influenza, URTI, etc.) are not listed, when in fact, they are part of the given options. The final diagnosis of Influenza is incorrect given the symptoms described and the options available. Based on these observations, the response does not align properly with the contextual details provided in the input, reflecting a misunderstanding and misinterpretation of the given information and failing to provide a diagnosis consistent with the input data, particularly missing the correct label, URTI. Therefore, the contextual accuracy is poor.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
