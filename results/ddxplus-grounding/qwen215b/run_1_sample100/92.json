Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 25\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - upper chest\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - nowhere\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 25-year-old female with sensitive, fixed pain on the side of the chest, especially the right, and a difficulty breathing when breathing deeply.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE has several inaccuracies in relation to the INPUT provided. \n\n1. The response incorrectly states that the patient has \"difficulty breathing when breathing deeply,\" whereas the INPUT clearly states that the patient does not experience increased pain when breathing deeply, and there is no significant shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.\n2. The INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly dismisses \"Pulmonary embolism\" as not related to chest pain, even though chest pain is a common symptom of pulmonary embolism.\n3. The analysis of other conditions often includes incorrect descriptions or irrelevant information, such as \"Tightness, not pain\" for pneumothorax, or dismissing options based on symptoms not necessary to rule them out (e.g., fever and rashes for pericarditis that are not mandatory for diagnosis).\n4. The most probable diagnosis according to the response, \"Acute dystonic reactions,\" doesn't align with the symptoms provided.\n\nTherefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not align with the specific context of the patient details and medical information given in the INPUT, demonstrating poor contextual accuracy.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
