Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE shows an incorrect understanding of the provided INPUT. The given patient details indicate a 7-year-old female with no significant symptoms of shortness of breath, difficulty keeping the tongue in the mouth, eyelid issues, neck soreness, jaw pain, or relevant travel history, but the INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly states the patient has these symptoms. Therefore, the reasoning process is based on an inaccurate portrayal of the symptoms. The conclusion that the most likely diagnosis is \"Acute dystonic reactions\" is flawed due to the incorrect symptom listing. Additionally, no part of the symptom analysis aligns with the provided patient details from the INPUT.\n\nThe inaccuracies demonstrate a lack of contextual accuracy because the response doesn't tailor the analysis to the specific patient details provided. As a result, the response does not provide precise and tailored insights based on the details from the INPUT.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
