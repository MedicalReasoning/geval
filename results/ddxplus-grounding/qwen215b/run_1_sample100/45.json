Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "Based on the INPUT, the patient is a 51-year-old male experiencing chest pain, which is characterized as sensitive and knife-like, with intensity rated as 5 out of 10. The pain radiates to multiple locations, including both sides of the chest and the scapula. There is swelling noted on the left posterior ankle and calf, although shortness of breath and pain during deep breathing are absent. There's no history of cancer, DVT, long immobility, or recent surgery mentioned.\n\nThe INITIAL RESPONSE inaccurately interprets several details:\n1. The pain is inaccurately stated as located only in the \"right lower chest,\" although it radiates extensively according to the INPUT.\n2. The response claims there is \"no radiating to other locations,\" which contradicts the input.\n3. It incorrectly states, \"not affecting breathing,\" without noting that shortness of breath, although a significant symptom to exclude, was directly answered as \"N\".\n4. It suggests that \"swelling, surgery, or recent travel\" are not concerns despite some presence of swelling.\n5. Most critically, it concludes with myocarditis as a primary consideration. This overlooks the Pulmonary Embolism, which, given swelling in the leg and chest pain, among other reasons, could be highly relevant to the symptoms presented.\n\nHence, this leads to inconsistencies in alignment and contextual understanding about assessing possible conditions. The option list in the INPUT mentions \"Pulmonary embolism,\" which should have been considered a more favorable match for the set of symptoms reported.\n\nThe inconsistency in assessment criteria across the age or other stating factors doesn't significantly align with the initial problem constraints described.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
