Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 52\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\n    - iliac fossa(L)\\n    - hip(R)\\n    - hip(L)\\n    - testicle(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have any lesions, redness or problems on your skin that you believe are related to the condition you are consulting for?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - pale\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - N\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - iliac fossa(L)\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - Y\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWere you born prematurely or did you suffer any complication at birth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have intense coughing fits?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre the symptoms or pain increased with coughing, with an effort like lifting a weight or from forcing a bowel movement?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Inguinal hernia\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Whooping cough\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 52-year-old male with pain in the iliac fossa (lower abdomen) and a rash associated with the pain.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provided is not contextually accurate. The patient is experiencing pain specifically in the iliac fossa region, has associated rash symptoms, and also confirms the presence of larger-than-1cm lesions, none of which are considered in the conclusion of bronchitis. An inguinal hernia, which involves the iliac region, is not considered as a valid possibility, despite matching the input symptoms more closely than bronchitis does. Bronchitis primarily involves respiratory symptoms like coughing and chest discomfort, not the symptoms presented by this patient such as purely iliac region pain and rash without coughing. Therefore, the response fails to align with the detailed and specific context provided in the input.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
