Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 35\\nSex: F\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you had a cold in the last 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that the tone of your voice has become deeper, softer or hoarse?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute laryngitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Epiglottitis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe patient reports throat pain, tonsillar pain, and difficulty swallowing. The pain is described as sensitive and burning. The patient does not smoke, feel fever, cough, or have traveled during the last few weeks.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAcute laryngitis: Can cause throat pain.\n\nBronchitis: Can present with cough and sore throat.\n\nTuberculosis: Can induce fever and cough. However, the patient does not have fever, cough, or throat pain.\n\nEpiglottitis: Not usually associated with throat pain or pharyngeal symptoms.\n\nViral pharyngitis: Can cause throat pain and other common symptoms. However, the patient does not have fever.\n\nPossible NSTEMI / STEMI: Refers to myocardial ischemia, which can mimic throat pain but is more severe and would require immediate medical attention.\n\nUnstable angina: Can lead to chest pain but usually does not meet the patient's criteria.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis based on the symptoms provided is: Acute laryngitis.\n\n```Acute laryngitis```\n\nLABEL:\nAcute laryngitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The initial response correctly analyzes the patient's symptoms and matches them to the most likely condition from the given list of options. The response goes through each potential diagnosis and considers it against the symptoms provided, including the absence of smoking, fever, cough, and recent travel. It rules out options that require symptoms not present in the input (like fever and cough for tuberculosis), and identifies acute laryngitis as the most fitting diagnosis due to the symptomatic throat pain, without the fever typically associated with other conditions like viral pharyngitis. This shows a nuanced understanding of the symptoms and their implications.\n\nThe answer provided is contextually accurate, as it aligns with the details given in the input about the patient's symptoms and makes an informed conclusion based on that analysis.\n\nPREDICTION: ```Yes```"
