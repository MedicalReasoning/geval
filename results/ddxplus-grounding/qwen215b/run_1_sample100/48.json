Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 59\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - mouth\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - nose\\n    - eye(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - back of head\\n    - nose\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you lost your sense of smell?\\n    - N\\nHave you had a cold in the last 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have polyps in your nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you have greenish or yellowish nasal discharge?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your vaccinations up to date?\\n    - N\\nAre you more likely to develop common allergies than the general population?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 59-year-old female with mouth, cheek, nose, eye pain, fever, loss of smell, past history of polyps, asthma, green nasal discharge, and no recent travel.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAcute rhinosinusitis: Severe, possibly accompanied by fever.\n\nChronic rhinosinusitis: Usually non-severe.\n\nAcute laryngitis: Larynx pain, not nose.\n\nChagas: Rare in developed countries and not often associated with nasal symptoms.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is Acute rhinosinusitis.\n\n```Acute rhinosinusitis```\n\nLABEL:\nAcute rhinosinusitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inaccuracies when compared to the INPUT data. The response mentions fever, loss of smell, past history of polyps, asthma, and green nasal discharge, none of which are supported by the INPUT; all these conditions were reported as 'No' by the patient. The response fails to capture the details correctly and provides assumptions not aligned with the provided data. Additionally, the reasoning provided in the INITIAL RESPONSE doesnâ€™t accurately reflect the context, particularly overlooking that fever and other conditions were explicitly negated in the evidence. Though it attempts to diagnose based on the options given, the mismatch in symptoms and data leads to a poor contextual alignment. Therefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not accurately reflect the INPUT provided.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
