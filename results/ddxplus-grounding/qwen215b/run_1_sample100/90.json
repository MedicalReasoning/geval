Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provided inaccurately addresses the context of the INPUT. Although the response concludes that the diagnosis is \"Cluster headache,\" several inaccuracies and missed details detract from its contextual accuracy. Firstly, the response incorrectly states that the 29-year-old male has a history of cluster headaches, whereas the INPUT specifies no family history of such headaches and no current pain, despite listing numerous pain characteristics. Secondly, the reasoning provided overlooks important details, such as the nature and location of the pain, whether it radiates or not, and the speed of onsetâ€”factors that could influence the final assessment. Furthermore, the response incorrectly dismisses anemia without thorough reasoning, stating only that it was not one of the given options when it actually is.\n\nThus, the response fails to align properly with the details of the INPUT, demonstrating a misunderstanding and overlooking critical information necessary for an accurate contextual analysis.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
