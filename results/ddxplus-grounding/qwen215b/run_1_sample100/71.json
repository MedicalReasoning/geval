Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not accurately address the context provided. The patient, a 31-year-old female, does not report feeling dizzy or lightheaded, yet the response incorrectly describes her as experiencing these symptoms. Additionally, the analysis of medical conditions and the eventual conclusion that her condition reflects a \"normal clinical presentation\" is incorrect because it does not take into account the options provided.\n\nFurthermore, the response includes irrelevant analyses, such as references to hypothyroidism and hypertension which are not mentioned in the INPUT. The INITIAL RESPONSE fails to consider the details of the INPUT accurately and dismisses the provided options without correctly aligning them with the symptoms detailed. The confusion with symptoms and irrelevant condition analyses indicate a misinterpretation of the context.\n\nTherefore, based on the above observations: \n\nPREDICTION```No```"
