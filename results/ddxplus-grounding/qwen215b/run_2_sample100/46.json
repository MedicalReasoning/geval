Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "Upon reviewing the INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE, it's evident that there are discrepancies between the provided information and the analysis in the response. The INPUT stipulates that the patient did not report fainting, yet the INITIAL RESPONSE introduces a \"history of fainting,\" which misrepresents the patient details. This indicates a misinterpretation or addition of non-existent information. Furthermore, the INITIAL RESPONSE mentions eyelid problems and stimulant use, yet this is not aligned with the INPUT data. This suggests a misunderstanding of the contextual medical details, and consequently, the reasoning and analysis concerning \"Acute dystonic reactions\" appear to be improperly tailored to the context. The conclusion seems to be drawn without accurately reflecting the patient-specific information delineated in the INPUT.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
