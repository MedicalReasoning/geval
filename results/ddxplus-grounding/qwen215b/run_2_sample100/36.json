Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 10\\nSex: F\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDid your cheeks suddenly turn red?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any lesions, redness or problems on your skin that you believe are related to the condition you are consulting for?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - pink\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - N\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - biceps(R)\\n    - biceps(L)\\n    - mouth\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - ankle(R)\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - Y\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you feeling nauseous or do you feel like vomiting?\\n    - N\\nDid you eat dark-fleshed fish (such as tuna) or Swiss cheese before the reaction occurred?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 10-year-old with shortness of breath and difficulty breathing, and a red skin lesion.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE shows multiple discrepancies when compared to the INPUT. Firstly, the INITIAL RESPONSE mentions shortness of breath and a red skin lesion, whereas the INPUT explicitly states that the patient does not experience shortness of breath and the rash is pink (not red). Furthermore, the INITIAL RESPONSE describes the lesion as not swollen and not large, while the INPUT indicates that the swelling score is 1 and the lesions are larger than 1cm. \n\nThe diagnosis reasoning provided in the INITIAL RESPONSE seems to overlook critical details from the INPUT, such as the itchiness being severe (score of 10), pain intensity being 3, and the lack of travel or ingestion of dark-fleshed fish. Additionally, there is a misunderstanding in assessing the differential diagnosis, as it wrongly repeats that none of the options cause shortness of breath while this symptom is absent in the provided context.\n\nDue to these significant errors and mismatches with the provided information, I evaluate the INITIAL RESPONSE as failing to accurately address the context.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
