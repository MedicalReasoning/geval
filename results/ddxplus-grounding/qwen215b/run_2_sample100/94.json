Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates inaccuracies in interpreting the INPUT details and misaligns with the provided context. Firstly, the response incorrectly states \"a history of anemia,\" while the INPUT explicitly indicates no history or family history of anemia. This misinterpretation leads to an incorrect conclusion about anemia being the most likely diagnosis. Additionally, the character of the pain and other symptoms in the INPUT does not align with anemia. The response overlooks the detailed context provided such as the intensity and location of the pain, and mistakenly considers conditions based on incorrect inferences, further misjudging chronicity and acute situations. Therefore, the response does not accurately reflect the INPUT and fails to align appropriately with the specific patient details.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
