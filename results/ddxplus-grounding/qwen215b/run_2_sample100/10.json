Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The initial response shows a significant lack of alignment with the context provided. The response incorrectly interprets the input details, stating that the patient has \"no pain,\" while in fact, multiple pain locations are specified in the input (e.g., side of the chest, scapula), with a high pain intensity of 8. This oversight indicates a misunderstanding of the provided information.\n\nFurthermore, the response provides a rationale for excluding conditions based on the absence of shortness of breath or coughing up blood, yet these characteristics may not rule out all the conditions listed, such as a pulmonary embolism. Importantly, the correct label of \"Pulmonary embolism\" is not adequately considered or reasoned through in the response.\n\nAdditionally, the conclusion of \"Myocarditis\" contradicts the information mentioned earlier in the response, incorrectly stating \"not typically due to chest pain,\" which lacks coherence and understanding of the context.\n\nOverall, this response fails to provide an accurate, tailored analysis based on the input, inaccurately portraying the patient's situation and not considering the correct diagnosis in its conclusion.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
