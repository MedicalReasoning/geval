Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly interprets the INPUT data. It mentions increased sweating when the INPUT clearly states that the patient did not experience significantly increased sweating. Additionally, the response states, \"no pain associated,\" which contradicts the INPUT that describes pain in the top of the head, cheeks, and occiput with an intensity of 6 out of 10. These errors suggest a misunderstanding of the patient's symptoms. Furthermore, the conclusion of URTI (Upper Respiratory Tract Infection) as a diagnosis does not align with the symptoms provided. According to the INPUT, the patient does not have symptoms commonly associated with URTI like a cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, or fever. Therefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the details provided in the INPUT, making it contextually inaccurate.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
