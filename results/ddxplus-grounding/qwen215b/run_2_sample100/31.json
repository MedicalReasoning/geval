Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains multiple inaccuracies. It incorrectly mentions \"bilateral painful swollen lymph nodes\" and \"loss of consciousness,\" which do not align with the INPUT data. The INPUT explicitly states that there are no swollen or painful lymph nodes and no loss of consciousness associated with muscle contractions or absence episodes. The response also overlooks the fact that the INPUT primarily indicates pain in various fingers without any systemic symptoms. Additionally, the analysis misrepresents information related to the options and the patient's symptoms, failing to accurately align with the context provided. Therefore, due to these discrepancies and the lack of contextual accuracy, the prediction should be:\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
