Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inaccuracies regarding the specific details provided in the INPUT. \n\n1. The individual described does not report a burning sensation that starts in the stomach and goes up into the throat with a bitter taste, contrary to what the initial response claims. The input explicitly states \"Do you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth? - N\".\n\n2. The initial response mischaracterizes the presented symptoms, such as ignoring the overwhelming pain intensity of 9 out of 10 and multiple pain locations, while incorrectly implying symptoms consistent with GERD or Pericarditis based on provided INPUT.\n\n3. Additionally, the reasoning reaches an incorrect conclusion with the diagnosis of Pericarditis, which does not align with the provided LABEL of GERD. \n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not accurately address the context, as it overlooks critical details and misinterprets the provided information.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
