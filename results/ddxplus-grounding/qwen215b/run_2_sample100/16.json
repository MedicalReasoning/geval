Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inaccuracies when compared to the INPUT details. Firstly, the response incorrectly states that the patient has increased sweating, pain in the right side of the chest, and cramp-like pain radiating to the iliac fossa. However, the INPUT specifies that the patient denies increased sweating, and while the patient does have cramp-like pain, it is reported in the left side of the chest, the left iliac fossa, and other areas, not specifically radiating. Additionally, the INITIAL RESPONSE mentions the patient has a history of panic attacks and an initial HIV infection, but the INPUT clearly states that the patient has no psychiatric illnesses, no depression, and no mention of HIV-related issues. These discrepancies indicate a failure in accurately interpreting and aligning with the provided patient details, leading to a conclusion of a possible NSTEMI / STEMI which does not harmonize with the final expected diagnosis of a Panic attack, as indicated by the LABEL.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
