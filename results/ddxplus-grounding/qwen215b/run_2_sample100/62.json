Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 39\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed any new fatigue, generalized and vague discomfort, diffuse (widespread) muscle aches or a change in your general well-being related to your consultation today?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pericarditis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Myocarditis\\n- GERD\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- PSVT\\n- Panic attack\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Chagas\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 39-year-old female with pain (a knife stroke) in the right breast (L), feeling it, not radiating, not precise, and not fast.

    "prediction": "1. The INITIAL RESPONSE inaccurately describes the location of the patient's pain as \"right breast (L)\", which is contradictory. The INPUT specifies the location as \"lower chest, upper chest, breast(L)\", indicating the left side, not the right.\n\n2. The analysis of symptoms in relation to the options provided is inadequate. For instance, it dismisses myocarditis by stating \"Not typically with symptoms,\" without adequate justification or consideration of varying presentations of myocarditis which can include chest pain.\n\n3. The response focuses on \"Panic attack\" as the most probable diagnosis, but doesn't adequately correlate the given symptoms or rule out other possibilities in relevance to the context provided, like myocarditis.\n\n4. The response shows a lack of depth in analyzing each provided option against the specific symptoms of the patient, overlooking key aspects like the character and intensity of the pain not aligning with a panic attack.\n\n5. INITIAL RESPONSE does not address the specific patient characteristics in relation to myocarditis, which could have been a suggested diagnosis as per the LABEL.\n\nBased on these observations, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not adequately and accurately address the context provided in the INPUT.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
