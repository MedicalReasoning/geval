Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 4\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Croup\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 4-year-old girl with pain on the side of the chest, characterized as burning.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inaccuracies and omissions in relation to the INPUT:\n1. The response incorrectly states that the pain does not feel like it radiates, is specified in precision, and occurred suddenly. The patient indicates precise locations for pain and its characteristics.\n2. The response claims the patient does not have a cough, whereas the INPUT only rules out productive cough.\n3. The diagnosis given heavily relies on common symptoms which are not present (e.g., pneumonia with sputum and fever), not aligning with the INPUT's data.\n4. The conclusion of \"pneumonia\" is inconsistent with both the patient's absence of common pneumonia symptoms (e.g., fever, productive cough) as well as the label, which identifies \"bronchitis\" as the correct condition.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE inaccurately interprets several key aspects from the INPUT and provides a conclusion that is not well-supported by the patient details. \n\nTherefore, the appropriate evaluation for the INITIAL RESPONSE is:\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
