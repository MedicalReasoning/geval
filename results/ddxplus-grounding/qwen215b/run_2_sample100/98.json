Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context provided in the INPUT. The patient is experiencing specific symptoms, such as burning and sensitive pain in various chest areas. The response incorrectly suggests that Bronchitis is the most probable diagnosis, even though the patient does not have a cough, fever, or other symptoms typically associated with Bronchitis. Additionally, the response erroneously states that the pain \"appeared 0 days,\" which is a misunderstanding of the data provided (\"How fast did the pain appear? - 0\" likely means the pain appeared suddenly, not that it isn't present). The response also mentions the patient as \"he\" while the provided information indicates the patient is female (\"Sex: F\"). Furthermore, other potentially relevant diagnoses such as GERD are prematurely dismissed or introduced without contextual accuracy.\n\nTherefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE overlooks important context, misinterprets the presented evidence, and includes inaccuracies, demonstrating a poor alignment with the medical situation described.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
