Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The task is to evaluate the INITIAL RESPONSE based on the given INPUT and determine if it has Contextual Accuracy according to the specified criterion.\n\nThe INPUT provides a comprehensive list of symptoms and indicates that the patient is not experiencing anxiety. The symptoms focus on pain described as cramping in the chest, with specified locations and intensity ratings provided. An array of potential diagnoses is listed, and none of the answers indicate immediate or clear links to a panic attack.\n\nThe INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly references a recent cholecystectomy and anxiety (stating the patient feels anxious), which are not mentioned in the INPUT. The patient clearly indicated that they do not feel anxious. The analysis of potential diagnoses is largely unrelated to the input context, focusing heavily on irrelevances and misunderstandings like cholecystectomy effects which were never mentioned or implied.\n\nHence, the response misrepresents critical patient details and circumstances by introducing unrelated medical conditions and assumptions about patient history without any basis in the input text. Additionally, the conclusion drawn does not align with provided evidence where the patient explicitly denied feeling anxious.\n\nBased on these observations, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not exhibit contextually accurate and relevant understanding of the provided medical context.\n\nPREDICTION: ```PREDICTION```No```"
