Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "1. The INPUT details a 20-year-old male patient with specific pain characteristics but no family history of cluster headaches. The pain is described as haunting, knife stroke, tugging, violent and sharp, located on the forehead, cheek, eye, and temple. The pain does not radiate, has a high intensity (7/10), and appeared fairly quickly (7/10). There are no symptoms of excessive tearing or nasal congestion, and the patient has not traveled abroad recently. The differential diagnosis options given are Cluster headache, Chagas, and Anemia.\n\n2. The INITIAL RESPONSE summarizes the patient as having no family history of cluster headaches or pain, which is accurate in context. However, it does not mention the pain being in the cheek, eye, and temple as well, which is a critical detail. The evaluation of Cluster headaches in the response is also incorrect as it states \"malignant, persistent, and self-limiting\" which are not the typical descriptors for cluster headaches. Additionally, the response fails to consider the specific characteristics of cluster headaches such as severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital, and/or temporal pain accompanied by autonomic symptoms, which are absent in the given evidence.\n\n3. The response does not align well with the context provided and contains inaccuracies and omissions regarding the medical information and patient details making it fail in contextual accuracy.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
