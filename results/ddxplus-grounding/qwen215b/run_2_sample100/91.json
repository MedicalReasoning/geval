Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The Initial Response inaccurately concludes with a diagnosis of \"Myocarditis\" based on the patient's symptoms and conditions. The Input reveals that the patient is experiencing severe pain (rated 8/10), without any indication of fluid in the lungs or undergoing dialysis, increased sweating, or heart failure. While dealing with a tedious pain in multiple locations, including the chest, calf, and biceps, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not correctly address or interpret these symptoms. Important details such as pain radiating to multiple locations and an intensity level of 8 are crucial considerations for diagnoses like \"Acute pulmonary edema\" — the corrective label — or potential myocardial conditions rather than \"Myocarditis.\" Moreover, the Initial Response's rationale is flawed, incorrectly dismissing relevant symptoms or overemphasizing less indicative factors. Therefore, based on the inadequacy of context-specific alignment and misdiagnosis, the evaluation of the Initial Response according to the context is:\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
