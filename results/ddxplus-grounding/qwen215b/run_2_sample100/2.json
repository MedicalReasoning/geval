Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE fails to appropriately align with the specific context provided in the INPUT. The main flaw in the response is the conclusion that anemia is the most probable diagnosis despite the absence of signs or symptoms indicative of anemia in the patient's details. The INPUT indicates that the patient has no diagnosis or family history of anemia and is not experiencing any relevant symptoms like shortness of breath, dizziness, or blood loss. Yet, the conclusion made is that anemia is the most probable diagnosis, which contradicts the provided information.\n\nFurthermore, the reasonings provided for ruling out other conditions are not aligned well with the context. For example, the response mentions \"Cluster headache: Severe, bilateral pain, often with nausea,\" while the patient reports specific localized head pain with an intensity of 4, which could potentially align with a cluster headache more than anemia, given the context.\n\nTherefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to incorporate a nuanced understanding of the context and bases its conclusion on irrelevant justifications rather than aligning with the specific medical details of the INPUT.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
