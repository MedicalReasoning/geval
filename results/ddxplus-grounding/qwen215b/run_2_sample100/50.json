Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 16\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain that improves when you lean forward?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - side of the neck(R)\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you regularly take stimulant drugs?\\n    - N\\nDo you have difficulty swallowing, or have a feeling of discomfort/blockage when swallowing?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that you produce more saliva than usual?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America\\nHave you noticed that the tone of your voice has become deeper, softer or hoarse?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Epiglottitis\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Larygospasm\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Chagas\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Viral pharyngitis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nAn 16-year-old male with pain that improves with leaning forward, related to his reason for consulting, and pain in the tonsil, side of the neck, pharynx, under the jaw, and tonsil.

    "prediction": "The initial response inaccurately reiterates details that aren't present in the input, such as \"pain that improves with leaning forward,\" which the input specifies as \"N,\" meaning 'No'. Furthermore, it suggests symptoms like \"feels comfortable swallowing,\" \"experiences shortness of breath,\" \"has diabetes,\" \"breathes through a high-pitched sound,\" \"has not traveled outside the U.S.,\" and \"has a hoarse tone of voice,\" which contradict the input where these symptoms are all denied (marked as 'N'). Thus, the response lacks contextual accuracy by misrepresenting the patient's symptoms and details, leading to a miscalculation in diagnosing the condition as \"Viral pharyngitis,\" instead of fitting the LABEL's suggestion of \"Epiglottitis.\"\n\nTherefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails the Contextual Accuracy check.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
