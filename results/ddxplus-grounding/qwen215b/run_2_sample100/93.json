Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context due to several reasons. Firstly, it inaccurately states that bronchospasm/acute asthma exacerbation is not typically seen in children when, in fact, asthma is quite common in this age group. Secondly, it dismisses bronchitis due to a supposed fit with a cough, whereas the input explicitly states there's no cough. Lastly, the conclusion that the most likely diagnosis is Viral pharyngitis does not align with the symptom presentation, as Viral pharyngitis would typically be accompanied by more specific symptoms like a sore throat rather than chest pain. There is a clear disconnect between the provided evidence and the reasoning.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
