Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE needs to be evaluated for its Contextual Accuracy based on the given INPUT details. \n\nThe INITIAL RESPONSE inaccurately interprets several critical pieces of information:\n\n1. **Pain Description and Location**: The patient has pain in multiple locations: lower chest, sides of the chest, scapula, and posterior chest wall, rather than solely the right lower chest as the response states. Moreover, the pain radiates to both sides of the chest and both scapulas, but the response says \"no radiating to other locations\".\n\n2. **Swelling**: The INPUT states swelling is present in the posterior aspect of the left ankle and left calf, but the INITIAL RESPONSE claims \"no swelling\".\n\n3. **Medical Conditions**: The response dismisses \"pulmonary embolism\" as atypical, while the LABEL indicates \"pulmonary embolism\" as the correct diagnosis, showing a disconnection between the provided conditions and the laid-out options.\n\n4. **Generalization**: The response repeatedly uses \"Not typical for this age\" for most conditions without specific reasoning substantiated by medical data or context from the INPUT.\n\nDue to these factors, the Initial Response does not demonstrate a deep understanding or accurate representation of the context provided by the INPUT.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
