Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

He does not have any immediate family members with psychiatric illnesses. Pain is described as a \"cramp,\" not a typical anatomic site, and the intensity is rated at 3. Pain does not radiate. The location is described as the side of the chest, not the iliac fossa or hypochondrium, which are more typical sites of thoracic pain. There is no history of shortness of breath. He denies a history of depression or chronic anxiety, but mentions feeling lightheaded and dizzy. He does not have numbness or tingling in the arms and legs. No recent travel history. He denies a history of asthma or bronchodilator use, and there is no history of anemia, pericarditis, or unstable angina. No recent experience with chest pain or dizziness, and no history of unstable angina. The anterior wall of the inferior myocardial infarction (STEMI) criteria are not met. The radiographic features of pulmonary embolism are not present. The patient has no history of sarcoidosis, pan- or chagasic disease, or Guillain-Barré syndrome. He does not have a history of GERD, atrial fibrillation, inguinal hernia, or boerhaave's reaction. The patient has not traveled internationally in the last four weeks.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates several issues with contextual accuracy as it misrepresents or omits key details from the INPUT and reaches a conclusion that is incompatible with the given LABEL.\n\n1. The response inaccurately states that the patient reports feeling anxious, when in fact the INPUT indicates he does not feel anxious.\n2. The pain description in the response is not entirely consistent with the INPUT. The response mentions pain in the \"right side of the chest,\" while the INPUT specifies pain in multiple locations: \"side of the chest(R),\" \"iliac fossa(R),\" \"hypochondrium(L),\" and \"breast(L).\"\n3. The response introduces details not present in the INPUT, such as feeling lightheaded and dizzy when the INPUT clearly states the patient does not.\n4. The conclusions about the patient's condition, emphasizing factors like \"anterior wall of the inferior myocardial infarction (STEMI) criteria,\" \"radiographic features of pulmonary embolism,\" and other conditions, are not grounded in information provided in the INPUT.\n5. Ultimately, the concluding diagnosis in the response — \"Unstable angina\" — contradicts the LABEL, which is \"Panic attack.\"\n\nDue to these discrepancies and misalignments, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately and appropriately address the context provided in the INPUT.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
