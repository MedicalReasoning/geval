Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 28\\nSex: F\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - forehead\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Influenza\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 28-year-old female with a sore throat, diffuse muscle pain, nasal congestion, and a cough without cough producing colored or more abundant sputum. \n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- URTI: Commonly presents with fever and cold symptoms.\n\n- Bronchitis: Common in smokers and has symptoms of cough and sore throat.\n\n- Pneumonia: Presents with fever, cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath.\n\n- Influenza: Viral infection, typically presenting with fever and body aches.\n\n- Cluster headache: Sharp, severe, and frequent pain.\n\n- Bronchiectasis: Chronic cough and prolonged effort produces sputum.\n\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis: Chronic inflamed sinusitis.\n\n- Acute rhinosinusitis: Inflammation of the nasal passages.\n\n- Chagas: Anemia and heart failure.\n\n- Anemia: Red blood cell count below normal.\n\nNotably, the symptoms suggest a viral infection, which fits best with URTI.\n\n```URTI```\n\nLABEL:\nURTI\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inaccuracies and misinterpretations of the patient's symptoms and context provided in the INPUT. To evaluate its contextual accuracy:\n\n1. The patient symptoms in INPUT: The patient, a 28-year-old female, does NOT have a sore throat, diffuse muscle pain, nasal congestion, or a cough, contrary to what the INITIAL RESPONSE states. The actual symptoms reported in the INPUT are pain characterized as tedious, located on the forehead and left temple with an intensity level of 7, and no radiating pain. No respiratory symptoms or sore throat are reported.\n\n2. The diagnosis conclusion in the INITIAL RESPONSE: The conclusion that the symptoms suggest a \"viral infection\" or URTI is incorrect due to the misinterpretation of symptoms, as the patient details do not include any symptoms typically associated with a URTI. The key symptoms suggestive of a headache disorder rather than a respiratory infection.\n\nDue to these significant discrepancies and failure to accurately interpret and respond to the patient details, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks contextual accuracy.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
