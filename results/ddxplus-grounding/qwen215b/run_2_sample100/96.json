Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 97\\nSex: M\\nDo you have chest pain even at rest?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a spontaneous pneumothorax?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heartbreaking\\n    - violent\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - breast(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nHave any of your family members ever had a pneumothorax?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that are increased with physical exertion but alleviated with rest?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Unstable angina\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Stable angina\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Panic attack\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\n```Spontaneous pneumothorax```\n\nThe patient is a 97-year-old male with chest pain at rest and no previous history of chest pain or pneumothorax. The pain is described as \"heartbreaking\" and is centered in the left chest, with no radiating pain. The intensity of the pain is rated as 7 out of 10. The pain does not radiate, nor does it affect shortness of breath or breathing. There are no risk factors for other conditions (aging, smoking, travel, family history, etc.). The pain is not increased by physical exertion or alleviated by rest, nor does it occur when breathing deeply. The pain is not related to other conditions that are more concerning (angina, coronary events, heart failure, myocarditis, etc.). The patient is not experiencing any acute conditions that are life-threatening or need immediate medical attention.\n\nLABEL:\nSpontaneous pneumothorax\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

    "prediction": "1. **Initial Analysis**:\n   - The INPUT data presents a patient profile with several specific details about a 97-year-old male's symptoms related to chest pain.\n   - The structured options for diagnosis include conditions like unstable angina, pneumothorax, NSTEMI/STEMI, pulmonary embolism, among others.\n   - The crucial details include no chest pain history at rest, pain characterization as \"heartbreaking,\" pain location in the right chest, pain intensity, lack of radiating pain or significant shortness of breath, no increased pain with deep breathing, and absence of other risk factors or increased exertion pain.\n\n2. **Summary of INITIAL RESPONSE**:\n   - The INITIAL RESPONSE suggests the possibility of \"Spontaneous pneumothorax\", summarizing the patient's condition and symptoms.\n\n3. **Evaluation**:\n   - The INITIAL RESPONSE asserts that the chest pain is located in the \"left chest,\" which directly contradicts the INPUT's claim of pain in the right breast. This is a significant contextual error.\n   - The INITIAL RESPONSE describes the patient as having chest pain \"at rest,\" while the INPUT explicitly states no chest pain rests.\n   - These inaccuracies indicate a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the data.\n   - Based on INPUT, critical details and contextual alignment seem to be missing in the response, leading to potential misdiagnosis or misalignment with evident options and details.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - The INITIAL RESPONSE does not meet the criterion of contextual accuracy. The errors in symptom location and interpretation of symptoms form the basis for a conclusion that isn't fully aligned with the data provided in INPUT.\n   \n5. **Explanation**:\n   - The errors in detail comprehension, particularly regarding pain localization and interpretation of symptoms, demonstrate a lack of proper contextual understanding; hence this affects the contextual accuracy negatively.\n\nPREDICTION: ```PREDICTION```No```"
