Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 35\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - side of the neck(R)\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - trachea\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high blood pressure or do you take medications to treat high blood pressure?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that the tone of your voice has become deeper, softer or hoarse?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Epiglottitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Larygospasm\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Unstable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 35-year-old female with throat pain (knife-like, sharp), pain localized to the tonsils, difficulty breathing, and no shortness of breath.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE attempts to analyze the patient's symptoms and match them with the provided differential diagnoses. However, there are inaccuracies in both the interpretation of symptoms and the conclusions drawn.\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of Symptoms**: \n   - The INITIAL RESPONSE states \"difficulty breathing,\" which contradicts the INPUT where the patient does not report significant breathing difficulties (\"Are you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way? - N\").\n   - It mentions \"no shortness of breath,\" aligning with the INPUT, but then uses \"difficulty breathing\" in the analysis, creating an inconsistency.\n\n2. **Analysis of Differential Diagnoses**:\n   - The assessment of Epiglottitis is not accurate, as the response states it is not a symptom of the patient's symptoms, which is not explicitly justified given the presentation of throat pain.\n   - Acute laryngitis and viral pharyngitis are dismissed as not associated with throat pain, which contradicts common clinical presentations where throat pain is a key symptom.\n   - The chosen diagnosis, Pulmonary embolism, is inconsistent with the patient profile and contradicts their symptoms of local, sharp throat pain without shortness of breath.\n\n3. **Conclusion Alignment**: \n   - The conclusion of Pulmonary embolism is a mismatch with the symptom profile provided, as there are no signs of respiratory issues or risk factors indicating pulmonary embolism.\n\nTherefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately and contextually align with the provided information. The conclusion does not fit the patient data or medical context, showing flawed reasoning and interpretations of the symptoms given. \n\nThe response does not demonstrate a nuanced understanding of the context and thus lacks contextually accurate alignment.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
