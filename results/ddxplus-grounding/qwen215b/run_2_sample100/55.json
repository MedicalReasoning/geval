Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 68\\nSex: M\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - temple(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Influenza\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 68-year-old man without recent travel or close contact with others.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not exhibit contextual accuracy for several reasons. Firstly, it inaccurately states that the patient has a sore throat, whereas the input explicitly mentions the absence of a sore throat. Secondly, the initial response inaccurately focuses on Bronchitis as the most likely diagnosis without considering that the patient's principal symptom is localized pain in the forehead, cheeks, and temples with high intensity, which aligns more with severe headache disorders or sinusitis rather than Bronchitis. Furthermore, there is no indication of respiratory symptoms such as cough or difficulty breathing, which are crucial for diagnosing bronchitis. The response lacks a thorough analysis of the symptomatology matching conditions like cluster headache or rhinosinusitis, which are more relevant given the patient's headache and facial pain.\n\nThus, the INITIAL RESPONSE doesn't align accurately with the patient's symptoms or the correct diagnosis based on the provided list of options and misguides the consideration of the presented conditions.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
