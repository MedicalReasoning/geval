Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 4\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - sensitive\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - burning\\n    - scary\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - hypochondrium(R)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hiatal hernia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that get worse after eating?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N', 'options': '- GERD\\n- Anaphylaxis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 4-year-old male with a sensation of a knife stroke and burning sensation, most intense in the upper chest, radiating to the throat, with no elevation of blood pressure, no temperature, no dark urine.

The INPUT provides details on a 4-year-old male patient who is experiencing severe pain, with no significant additional symptoms or risk factors related to GERD or anaphylaxis.\n2. The INITIAL RESPONSE inaccurately describes some of the data from the INPUT, such as the location and nature of pain, and the lack of relevant symptoms tied to GERD or anaphylaxis.\n3. The reasoning provided does not fully align with the evidence, making assertions that aren't supported by the provided information, such as characterizing the patientâ€™s symptoms incorrectly.\n4. The conclusion drawn, a diagnosis of GERD, does not consider the context fully and introduces inaccuracies, especially given the absence of GERD-specific symptoms noted in the INPUT.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
