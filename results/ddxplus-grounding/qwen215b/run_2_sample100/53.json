Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provides an analysis of the symptoms but there are several inaccuracies in terms of contextual alignment with the specific patient details given in the INPUT:\n\n1. The INITIAL RESPONSE states, \"The pain is located in the side of the chest, not the lower chest, and not severe\", but in the INPUT, the patient describes the pain as being in the lower chest, sides of the chest (both left and right), and the pain intensity is noted as 10, which is the highest on the scale, indicating severe pain.\n\n2. The patient mentions the pain radiates to the posterior chest wall (both right and left), which is overlooked in the response.\n\n3. The INITIAL RESPONSE concludes with Bronchitis as the most likely diagnosis but lacks coherence with provided symptoms. The patient's described pain as \"heartbreaking\" with an intensity of 10 does not fit the common presentation of bronchitis, and they do not have the characteristic coughing fits usually associated with bronchitis.\n\n4. The actual label provided is Spontaneous rib fracture, which is more aligned with the nature of the described pain (sharp, knife-like) even though it's listed as rare. The INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly dismisses this condition without considering its relevancy to the severe pain and specific pain locations.\n\nThus, despite going through a systematic process, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately synthesize the given patient information, resulting in a conclusion that does not align well with the contextual details provided.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
