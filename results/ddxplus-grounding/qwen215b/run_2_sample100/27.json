Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INPUT describes a 39-year-old female experiencing cramp-like pain in various abdominal regions (flanks, iliac fossae, hypochondrium) with an intensity rating of 6 out of 10. The patient denies any anxiety, increased sweating, radiating pain, or associated respiratory symptoms (difficulty breathing, choking, suffocating, palpitations), which are typically relevant when considering a panic attack. The INITIAL RESPONSE inaccurately mentions \"intermittent, sharp pain in the flank and difficulty breathing,\" which is not present in the INPUT. Additionally, it concludes with a diagnosis of \"Panic attack,\" without appropriately considering all available information or accurately representing the patient-reported symptoms. Thus, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not demonstrate a clear and accurate understanding of the patient's context and symptoms.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
