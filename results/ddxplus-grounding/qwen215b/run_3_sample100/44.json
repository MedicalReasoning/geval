Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The initial response provided fails to accurately address the context of the INPUT. Firstly, it incorrectly mentions the presence of swollen lymph nodes and diarrhea, which the INPUT clearly states are not present (\"swollen or painful lymph nodes? - N\" and \"diarrhea or an increase in stool frequency? - N\"). Additionally, the initial response does not account for several key details from the INPUT, such as the specifics of the pain being located in the back of the neck, forehead, and temples, and the presence of a rash with certain characteristics such as its location and color. The analysis of the diagnostic options does not align well with the symptoms and details given, resulting in an erroneous conclusion of Sarcoidosis, which is not substantiated by the input data. Consequently, the initial response demonstrates poor alignment with the provided information, suggesting a lack of contextual accuracy.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
