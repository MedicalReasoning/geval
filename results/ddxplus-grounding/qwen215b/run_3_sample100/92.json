Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

It states \"difficulty breathing when breathing deeply\", which contradicts INPUT that clearly indicates \"No\" for shortness of breath or increased pain on deep breathing.\n2. The response incorrectly interprets pulmonary embolism as not related to chest pain. Chest pain is indeed a common symptom of pulmonary embolism.\n3. It recommends \"Acute dystonic reactions\", which doesn't align with the symptom profile provided in the INPUT.\n4. Important details like the locations where pain radiates are ignored in the analysis.\n5. The INPUT sets \"Pulmonary embolism\" as the label, while the response doesn't adequately consider or eliminate this as a potential diagnosis based on evidence.\n\nThe response overlooks critical details, misinterprets important data, and fails to align with the given patient situation and medical evidence.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
