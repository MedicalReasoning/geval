Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE is inaccurate in several key aspects:\n\n1. The response states that the chest pain does not radiate anywhere, whereas the INPUT describes the pain as radiating to multiple locations: both biceps, thyroid cartilage, thoracic spine, and right shoulder.\n   \n2. It mentions the pain as being localized to the left side of the chest at the level of the heart, while the INPUT specifies multiple pain locations, including both sides of the chest, upper chest, left breast, and epigastric region.\n\n3. The response fails to recognize that the pain is characterized as \"tedious\" and \"exhausting\" rather than \"tiredness\" and \"exhaustion,\" although this is a minor discrepancy.\n\n4. The diagnosis of \"Unstable angina\" in the INITIAL RESPONSE does not align with the diagnosis label of \"Stable angina.\" However, the response reasoning does not adequately justify why unstable angina was chosen, especially since the lack of shortness of breath and exercise-related symptoms may suggest stability rather than instability in symptoms.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE overlooks critical details from the context and misrepresents the symptoms, which leads to an inaccurate understanding and conclusion.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
