Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains multiple inaccuracies and misunderstandings regarding the context provided. The patient is actually experiencing pain, specifically characterized as tugging, cramping, and exhausting, located at the back of the head, forehead, and right temple with an intensity level of 4 out of 10. However, the INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly states that the patient has \"no pain at the moment\" and fails to appropriately consider the symptoms noted. Furthermore, the decision for anemia contradicts the provided information, which includes no personal or family history of anemia and normal menstruation. Other options such as cluster headache should have been considered more thoroughly due to the described head pain characteristics.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks contextual accuracy and does not reflect a proper understanding of the input data, leading to an inaccurate conclusion.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
