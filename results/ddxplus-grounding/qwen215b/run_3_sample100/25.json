Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE misinterprets key details of the INPUT and provides an inaccurate diagnosis. The INPUT clearly states that there is no burning sensation starting in the stomach and going up into the throat (related to symptoms of GERD), and does not provide any specific heart-related symptoms typically associated with Pericarditis. Furthermore, the INITIAL RESPONSE seems to misinterpret or invent symptoms, as it mentions a burning sensation and a bitter taste in the mouth that does not exist in the INPUT. The conclusion of Pericarditis lacks alignment with the facts presented in the INPUT, such as non-specific pain and no mention of heart symptoms that would suggest Pericarditis. Additionally, the probabilities of other conditions are not fully explored, particularly GERD which is part of the provided input. Therefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE is contextually inaccurate.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
