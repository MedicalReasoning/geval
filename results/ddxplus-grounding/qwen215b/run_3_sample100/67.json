Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 80\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Influenza\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Boerhaave\\n- GERD\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Chagas\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think through this step-by-step. \n\n- The patient is a 80-year-old woman with pain on the side of the chest (R) and feeling of burning.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not accurately align with the specific context provided in the INPUT. Here are the reasons for this:\n\n1. Misinterpretation of Details: \n   - The patient reports pain in multiple locations, including the right and left sides of the chest, upper chest, and left breast. However, the INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly states that the patient does not feel pain anywhere else. This inaccuracy indicates a misinterpretation of the pain distribution.\n   \n2. Pain Intensity Description:\n   - The INITIAL RESPONSE describes the pain intensity of 5 as \"extremely intense.\" However, on a scale from 0 to 10, a rating of 5 typically indicates moderate pain, not extreme.\n\n3. Timing of Pain:\n   - The INITIAL RESPONSE states that the pain occurred \"2 days ago,\" which is not mentioned in the INPUT. The timing is provided on a scale, but it does not convert directly to days.\n\n4. Lack of Contextual Diagnosis:\n   - The response fails to utilize the patient details to suggest a potential condition out of the given options. Instead, it concludes with \"No specific diagnosis\" without considering conditions that match the presented symptoms, such as Boerhaave syndrome or pericarditis, which could align with burning chest pain.\n\n5. Incorrect Inference about Medical History:\n   - The INITIAL RESPONSE assumes the patient lacks a history of heart or gastrointestinal conditions without basis from the INPUT. The INPUT does not mention a particular history of such conditions.\n\nGiven these issues, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not reflect a deep understanding of the context, accurately address the symptoms, or provide a coherent diagnosis reasoning. Therefore, it fails to meet the contextual accuracy criterion.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
