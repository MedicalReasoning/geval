Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains significant contextual inaccuracies related to the INPUT data. Key discrepancies include:\n\n1. The response incorrectly describes the patient as having increased sweating and right-sided chest pain, while the INPUT explicitly states the patient does not have increased sweating and reports pain on the left side of the chest.\n   \n2. It states the pain radiates to the iliac fossa, but the INPUT does not mention pain radiation.\n\n3. The initial assessment lists symptoms and medical history not present in the INPUT, such as a history of panic attacks, HIV diagnosis, and anemia treatment.\n\n4. The INITIAL RESPONSE's analysis and conclusion focus on possible NSTEMI / STEMI as the most probable diagnosis, contrary to the context of the INPUT which suggests \"Panic attack\" as the appropriate label. \n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not align accurately with the specific context and details provided in the INPUT. \n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
