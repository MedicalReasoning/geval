Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates several inaccuracies in interpreting the INPUT:\n\n1. The response inaccurately mentions, \"He feels pain and difficulty in breathing when he exhales,\" whereas the INPUT clearly states that the patient is not experiencing significant shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing and has not noticed a wheezing sound.\n   \n2. The response incorrectly states, \"His symptoms are more prominent at night,\" while the INPUT indicates otherwise.\n\n3. The patient's pain is described in the INPUT as having a low intensity (\"How intense is the pain? - 1\"), but this detail is omitted in the response, affecting the accuracy of the diagnosis provided.\n\n4. The response mentions various conditions it considers to be atypical for chest pain without detailed reasoning or distinction based on the context provided. For instance, it dismisses bronchitis outright without aligning with the input context where the patient is not experiencing a cough (often associated with bronchitis but not a mandatory symptom). \n\n5. Moreover, the conclusion drawn (\"The most probable diagnosis is Unstable angina.\") does not align with the label \"Bronchitis,\" and it lacks contextual justification based on the provided symptoms and patient history.\n\nOverall, these shortcomings signal that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks an accurate alignment with the specifics of the input scenario, leading to an incorrect and unsupported conclusion.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
