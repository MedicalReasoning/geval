Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context provided in the INPUT. The response begins by introducing new information not present in the INPUT, such as the patient having a recent cholecystectomy and feeling anxious, which are absent from the INPUT details. Moreover, the patient explicitly denied feeling anxious in the INPUT. Additionally, the INITIAL RESPONSE mischaracterizes the nature and location of the pain, stating that \"the location is not specified,\" whereas the INPUT provides specific locations for the pain. The analysis of the diagnostic options is not tailored to the specifics of the INPUT, with many options dismissed as \"not typical of cholecystectomy,\" which is irrelevant as there is no mention of a recent cholecystectomy in the INPUT. The conclusion that a \"Panic attack\" is the most probable diagnosis is inappropriate since the patient reports no anxiety or other symptoms associated with panic attacks. Overall, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not exhibit a nuanced understanding of the context provided.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
