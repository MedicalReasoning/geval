Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not properly align with the specific context provided in the INPUT. The INPUT details a list of symptoms that are primarily negative, meaning the patient does not exhibit symptoms typically associated with Myasthenia Gravis, such as muscle weakness or difficulty in performing movements. Instead, the patient denies any symptoms like trouble with eyelids, muscle spasms, or medication history that could suggest antipsychotic involvement, which is more relevant to ruling out acute dystonic reactions. Furthermore, the INITIAL RESPONSE jumps directly to concluding Myasthenia Gravis without sufficient justification based on the provided evidence, ignoring the absence of key indicators for both possibilities, which are particularly critical when distinguishing between the two choices. Therefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to incorporate and interpret all relevant aspects of the INPUT, leading to a misleading conclusion.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
