Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains several inaccuracies in the interpretation of the INPUT details:\n\n1. The response incorrectly describes the patient's symptoms, mentioning a sore throat, cough, and shortness of breath which are explicitly noted as absent (\"N\") in the INPUT.\n\n2. It inaccurately summarizes the pain locations as having \"No pain in the chest, pharynx, posterior chest wall, or upper chest,\" whereas the patient reported pain in these areas (upper chest, pharynx, posterior chest wall, breast) with a pain intensity of 1.\n\n3. The evaluation of each potential diagnosis in the options fails to integrate the specific details provided in the INPUT, resulting in a generic and sometimes irrelevant assessment.\n\n4. The response's conclusion of URTI does not align with the given context, especially with the absence of upper respiratory symptoms like cough or sore throat.\n\nThe label, \"Bronchitis,\" suggests reviewing possibilities like this should have been considered, but the response's reasoning did not examine this option in light of consistent clinical data.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to interpret the context accurately and contains multiple substantial errors and oversights. Thus, it does not align appropriately with the INPUT provided.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
