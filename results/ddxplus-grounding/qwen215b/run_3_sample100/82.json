Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE has several inaccuracies and omissions in addressing the context provided:\n\n1. The input explicitly states that the patient does not have a poor diet, yet the INITIAL RESPONSE misrepresents this detail by stating the patient has a poor diet.\n2. The input data includes specific pain characteristics and their location, intensity, and onset speed. However, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to properly incorporate all these aspects (e.g., the pain is described as located in both temples with specific intensity and speed of onset ratings).\n3. The INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly states \"not experiencing a panic attack\" when this wasn't concluded based on symptom analysis, but rather just asserted.\n4. The conclusion that Anemia is the \"most probable diagnosis\" contradicts the input's clear list of negative symptoms and history regarding anemia (no diagnosis, no family history, and no related symptoms).\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not accurately reflect or interpret the provided information and makes incorrect assumptions and conclusions.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
