Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE makes some errors in interpreting the INPUT. First, there is a mistake regarding the patient's attendance at a daycare; the input explicitly states \"N\" (No) for attending or working in a daycare, but the response says, \"She attended a daycare.\" Secondly, while the response considers both URTI and Acute rhinosinusitis as possible diagnoses, it should be noted that the patient has pain in specific areas (top of the head, cheek(R), cheek(L)) without typical symptoms of a URTI, such as runny nose or cough, which are crucial for the context. Moreover, the conclusion points to the lack of \"other common cold symptoms,\" but doesn't adequately justify why URTI is still being considered over other diagnoses listed with more specificity, like Acute rhinosinusitis, which is temporally associated with the symptoms provided, rather than being a variant of a common cold. This discrepancy shows a lack of nuanced understanding and interpretation of the specific patient details and symptoms. Therefore, the response does not accurately align with the context provided in the INPUT.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
