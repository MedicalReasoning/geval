Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "To evaluate the INITIAL RESPONSE based on Contextual Accuracy, let's consider the details provided in the INPUT and how well the response aligns with these details:\n\n1. **INPUT Evaluation**:\n   - The patient is a 47-year-old female.\n   - She does not regularly take stimulant drugs.\n   - She has never experienced suffocating sensations or shortness of breath with an inability to speak.\n   - She does not have difficulty with opening or raising eyelids.\n   - She has not traveled out of the country recently.\n   - She does not experience sudden difficulty opening her mouth or jaw pain.\n\n2. **INITIAL RESPONSE Evaluation**:\n   - The response correctly identifies the age and gender of the patient.\n   - It misattributes a \"history of fainting\" to the patient, which is not mentioned in the INPUT.\n   - The response incorrectly suggests that eyelid problems and other symptoms are present when, in fact, they were explicitly denied.\n   - The conclusion that \"the most probable diagnosis is Acute dystonic reactions\" is drawn without a clear connection to the symptoms (or lack thereof) provided in the INPUT.\n   - The response incorrectly references symptoms associated with stimulant use, which the patient has denied.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE contains inaccuracies and misinterpretations of the input data. It adds unverified medical history (fainting), includes possibly irrelevant information about stimulants, and inaccurately summarizes patient responses. Therefore, it demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient situation and lacks contextual accuracy.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
