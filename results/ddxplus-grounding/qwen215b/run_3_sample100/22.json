Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE is inaccurate as it contains multiple misunderstandings of the context provided in the INPUT and comes to a conclusion that is flawed based on the available information. \n\nFirstly, the response states, \"She does not feel the pain anywhere,\" which is incorrect as the INPUT clearly mentions pain at specific locations: side of the chest (right), breast (left), and posterior chest wall (left). These locations are crucial for formulating an accurate diagnosis. \n\nSecondly, the response suggests that the pain is not specified in terms of intensity or precision; however, the INPUT indicates an intensity of '2' and a location precision of '3'. Ignoring these details while analyzing symptoms undermines the context's specificity.\n\nAdditionally, the conclusion that \"The most likely diagnosis is Pneumonia\" contradicts the rationale earlier in the response where pneumonia is dismissed due to the absence of typical symptoms like fever and sputum production. Furthermore, the label for the correct diagnosis is 'Bronchitis,' which indicates that an accurate assessment should take into account the absence of sputum production and fever.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE overlooks crucial details and misinterprets the findings, leading to an inaccurate conclusion. \n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
