Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not accurately align with the specific context provided in the INPUT. Here are the key issues:\n\n1. The response inaccurately mentions symptoms such as \"coughing up blood\" and \"painful urination\", which the INPUT specifically states are not present. The INPUT clearly indicates that the patient has not been coughing up blood, does not have a cough, and no mention of painful urination is present.\n\n2. The response talks about \"extensive travel history,\" which is not supported by the INPUT. The INPUT clearly states that the patient has not traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks.\n\n3. The response reaches the conclusion of \"Pneumonia\" without a fever, cough, or travel history – key symptoms or risk factors typically associated with pneumonia. In fact, the INPUT explicitly states the patient does not have a fever or cough, weakening the conclusion that Pneumonia is the most probable diagnosis.\n\nThus, the INITIAL RESPONSE misinterprets the provided information and fails to provide a contextually accurate diagnosis based on the details given. \n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
