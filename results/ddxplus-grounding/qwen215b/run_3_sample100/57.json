Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 70\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - occiput\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Influenza\\n- Bronchitis\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 70-year-old female with no fever, no sore throat, no diffuse muscle pain, no nasal congestion, no cough, no travel, and having a pain that feels \"sensitive\" and radiates to the top of the head.

    "prediction": "The initial response contains significant inaccuracies and oversight of the details provided in the input. \n\n1. The INITIAL RESPONSE claims there is a rash on the cheeks, which is not mentioned in the INPUT. Adding non-existent symptoms misrepresents the patient's condition.\n2. It mentions that the pain radiates to the top of the head, which is also not supported by any information in the INPUT. The INPUT shows the pain as present in specific areas (top of the head, forehead, cheeks right and left, occiput) without indicating that it radiates elsewhere.\n3. The analysis of options and the diagnoses considered do not align with the patient's symptomatology given. For instance, Chronic rhinosinusitis and conditions requiring fever or other symptoms such as cough or nasal congestion are not supported by the data provided.\n4. The INITIAL RESPONSE overlooks the specific symptom description, particularly the pain characteristics, which are crucial to narrowing down the diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context of the patient's symptoms and incorrectly adds information not present in the INPUT. It also does not align with the LABEL provided, suggesting a poor understanding and application of the available information.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
