Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The initial response lacks contextual accuracy in several ways. Firstly, it misinterprets the context by stating the patient has \"rapidly developing severe shoulder pain,\" which is not mentioned in the INPUT; the pain is described in the \"upper chest,\" \"breast(L),\" and \"epigastric\" areas. The response also mentions pain when lying down, which contradicts the patient's negation of symptoms worsening in that position. Additionally, the analysis of the differential diagnosis seems arbitrary, failing to consider the comprehensive evidence provided in the INPUT appropriately. The suggested diagnosis of \"Acute dystonic reactions\" does not align with the evidence, especially when the label suggests \"Pericarditis\" as a reasonable diagnosis considering the context provided.\n\nThe INITIAL RESPONSE overlooks critical details and misinterprets the patient's symptoms, making it contextually inaccurate. Therefore, it does not align well with the specifics of the INPUT.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
