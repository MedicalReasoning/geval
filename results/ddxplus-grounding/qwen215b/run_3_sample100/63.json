Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not accurately reflect the INPUT context. The response incorrectly states that the patient has a \"burning sensation, most intense in the upper chest, radiating to the throat,\" whereas the actual INPUT specifies pain in the hypochondrium (R) and epigastric areas, and radiating to the lower and upper chest, not the throat. Additionally, the description of anaphylaxis as evaluated in the response does not align with the provided symptoms in the INPUT. Furthermore, the response concludes that the most probable diagnosis is GERD without considering that the symptoms are atypical for a 4-year-old, and simply dismisses anaphylaxis without sufficient explanation. Thus, the initial response misinterprets critical details and lacks context alignment.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
