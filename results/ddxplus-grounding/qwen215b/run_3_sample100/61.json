Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The Initial Response does not accurately align with the context provided. The provided patient details indicate throat-related symptoms with localized pain to the tonsils and related areas, without shortness of breath or hoarseness, and the selection context points towards options focusing on these clinical factors. However, the initial response mistakenly identifies \"Pulmonary embolism\" as the diagnosis, which does not align with the symptoms given, as this condition is more associated with respiratory distress and is not typically connected to knife-like sharp throat pain. The correct label is \"Epiglottitis,\" which aligns more closely with the throat-centric symptoms described, demonstrating a lack of context. Thus, the initial response does not reflect a nuanced understanding of the patient's situation.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
