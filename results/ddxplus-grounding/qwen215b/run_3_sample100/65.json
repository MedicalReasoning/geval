Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n\n[Criterion]\nContextual Accuracy (Yes / No): How accurately and appropriately does the INITIAL RESPONSE align with the specific context provided, such as patient details and medical information?\nThe initial response should reflect a deep understanding of the context, ensuring that all medical information, reasoning, and conclusions are tailored and relevant to the specific details and nuances of the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to accurately address the context, either by overlooking critical details, misinterpreting the provided information, or delivering generic or irrelevant content. Such a response demonstrates poor alignment with the given patient or medical situation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally contextually accurate, providing precise and tailored insights that align perfectly with the given details. The response incorporates all relevant aspects of the INPUT, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the context and ensuring that the information and reasoning are directly applicable and highly relevant to the situation described.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Contextual Accuracy decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 10\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - tugging\\n    - burning\\n    - sickening\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - hypochondrium(L)\\n    - belly\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - lower chest\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hiatal hernia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you think you are pregnant or are you currently pregnant?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently thrown up blood or something resembling coffee beans?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that get worse after eating?\\n    - N', 'options': '- GERD'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 10-year-old female with a sensitive, a knife stroke, and a burning sensation that starts in the stomach and goes up into the throat.

    "prediction": "The initial response contains several inaccuracies and misinterpretations of the contextual information provided:\n\n1. The response inaccurately attributes a burning sensation that starts in the stomach and goes up into the throat to the patient, despite the patient explicitly denying this symptom in the input.\n2. The analysis provided does not correctly reflect the symptoms described in the input, which are: sensation of pain in the hypochondrium and belly with characteristics such as sensitive, knife stroke, tugging, burning, sickening, and a pain intensity of 6.\n3. The response mentions asthma and hiatal hernia probabilities, which do not align with the patient's conditions per the input data.\n4. The response ultimately contradicts itself by discussing GERD multiple times without adequately linking it to the patient's actual symptoms as described.\n\nAs a result, the response does not align well with the specific context, patient details, and medical information provided in the input.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
