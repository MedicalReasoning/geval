Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 51\\nSex: M\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you had chills or shivers?\\n    - N\\nDo you have Parkinson’s disease?\\n    - N\\nDo you have heart failure?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had pneumonia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any lesions, redness or problems on your skin that you believe are related to the condition you are consulting for?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - pink\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - Y\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - cervical spine\\n    - thoracic spine\\n    - lumbar spine\\n    - buttock(L)\\n    - shoulder(L)\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - N\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHave you recently had a loss of appetite or do you get full more quickly then usually?\\n    - N\\nHave you had surgery within the last month?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nIs your BMI less than 18.5, or are you underweight?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 51-year-old male without a history of chills, heart failure, pneumonia, COPD, or lesions on his skin.

    "prediction": "The evaluation of the INITIAL RESPONSE with regard to the decision acumen criterion indicates several deficiencies.\n\nThe INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly associates several unrelated symptoms and conditions with pneumonia, such as \"painful urination\" and \"extensive travel history,\" which are not mentioned in the INPUT. Furthermore, it inaccurately describes the symptom profile, as the INPUT clearly states that the patient does not have a cough, cough producing colored sputum, fever, or history of pneumonia—all crucial indicators for the diagnosis of pneumonia.\n\nMoreover, the decision to diagnose pneumonia is made without adequate justification from the provided evidence. The response fails to systematically evaluate and eliminate other differential diagnoses listed in the options based on the evidence. For instance, the response does not adequately justify rejecting conditions like bronchitis or pulmonary neoplasm, which could also be plausible given the symptoms and the patient's age.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, an incorrect and unsupported diagnosis, and a failure to appropriately reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Therefore, the decision acumen of the response is weak.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
