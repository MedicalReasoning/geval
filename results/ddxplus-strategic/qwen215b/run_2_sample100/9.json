Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 38\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - exhausting\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - biceps(R)\\n    - biceps(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - thoracic spine\\n    - shoulder(R)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you constantly feel fatigued or do you have non-restful sleep?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you exercise regularly, 4 times per week or more?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that are increased with physical exertion but alleviated with rest?\\n    - N\\nDo you have close family members who had a cardiovascular disease problem before the age of 50?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Panic attack\\n- Anemia\\n- GERD\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- SLE\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Chagas\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- PSVT\\n- Pulmonary embolism'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 38-year-old female with a characterizing chest pain of tiredness and exhaustion in the left side of the chest, with a painless discomfort localized to the left side of the chest with a dull ache and a 5 on a scale of 1-10.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not effectively demonstrate decision-making skills and deliberation. It inaccurately reports the evidence; for instance, it states that the pain does not radiate when the INPUT specifies several locations where the pain does radiate. The response misidentifies the pain as quick to appear and locates it at the heart level, but the INPUT characterizes the pain differently. Furthermore, despite analyzing some symptoms, the conclusion drawn – \"Unstable angina\" – does not match the evidence and seems to disregard several details, including no increase in pain with exertion or family history of cardiovascular problems, both critical for diagnosing angina. The patient also does not report shortness of breath, which is a feature of angina. Hence, the decision is neither deliberated thoughtfully nor is it accurate as per the INPUT.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
