Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 51\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - sensitive\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - tugging\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\n    - belly\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you think you are pregnant or are you currently pregnant?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that get worse after eating?\\n    - N', 'options': '- GERD\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nPatient is 51 years old with a burning sensation associated with a bitter taste in the mouth, no cough, no traveling in the last 4 weeks.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE displays poor decision-making for several reasons:\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of Key Details**: The response incorrectly describes the patient's symptoms. The patient does not report a burning sensation or bitter taste in their mouth, which are being wrongly ascribed, impacting the subsequent analysis of GERD. The patient explicitly stated 'N' in the symptoms, indicating no burning sensation, which is a crucial diagnostic feature of GERD.\n\n2. **Ignoring Evidence**: The analysis of conditions such as GERD was not adequately tied to the correct details from the input. The response fails to use critical symptoms like 'no burning sensation', impacting the analysis severely. Since it is the closest symptom association present, GERD should not be as quickly dismissed without proper deliberation.\n\n3. **Incorrect Diagnosis**: The response considers 'Spontaneous rib fracture' the most likely diagnosis without robust backing from the described symptoms. This condition should rather be reconsidered given the nature of the presented symptoms (e.g., types of pain described in the input).\n\n4. **Redundancy & Inaccuracy**: The response redundantly lists certain conditions like 'Stable angina' twice, indicating a lack of precision in the distinction of options and an incoherent process.\n\nOverall, the response lacks the necessary precision and logic required to arrive at a well-founded conclusion. The diagnosis does not align with the given evidence, failing to demonstrate exceptional decision acumen.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
