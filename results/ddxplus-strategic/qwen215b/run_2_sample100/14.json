Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 45\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - mouth\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - nose\\n    - eye(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - back of head\\n    - nose\\n    - temple(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nHave you lost your sense of smell?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had pneumonia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have polyps in your nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a deviated nasal septum?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you more likely to develop common allergies than the general population?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 45-year-old female with sharp pain in her forehead, cheek(L), nose, eye(R), and a 3 on a scale of 1-10 for the intensity.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not effectively make concise and precise decisions by thoroughly evaluating the available information, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. Here are some observations regarding the decision-making process:\n\n1. **Lack of Analysis on Given Symptoms**: The response mentions sharp pain in various facial regions, yet it incorrectly states that the pain \"does not radiate\" despite the INPUT indicating radiation to multiple locations including the back of the head and temple regions.\n\n2. **Consideration of Options**: The response briefly describes each condition but does not adequately explain why each diagnosis is likely or unlikely given the patient's symptoms.\n\n3. **Final Decision**: The choice of Viral pharyngitis is not well-supported by the evidence provided. Viral pharyngitis typically involves throat symptoms, which are not prominently described in the INPUT. Furthermore, the description for Viral pharyngitis seems to be cut-off with just \"Sharp pain in throat,\" providing limited evidence from the INPUT to support this as the most likely diagnosis.\n\n4. **Incorrect Conclusion**: The actual correct label according to the task is Chronic rhinosinusitis, which aligns more with the provided symptoms (e.g., facial pain without inflammation, nasal issues). The INITIAL RESPONSE fails to identify this based on the evidence.\n\nGiven these points, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks precise decision-making and reasoning grounded in the INPUT, ultimately leading to an incorrect conclusion.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
