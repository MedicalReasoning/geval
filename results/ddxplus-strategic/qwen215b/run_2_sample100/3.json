Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 45\\nSex: F\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - occiput\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Influenza\\n- URTI\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 45-year-old female not living with family or attending daycare.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE fails to exhibit strong decision acumen because it makes several errors in reasoning and decision-making:\n\n1. The response incorrectly concludes that \"Influenza\" is not listed in the options, even though it actually is listed. This demonstrates a lack of attention to detail and undermines the credibility of the decision-making process.\n\n2. Several conditions, including Pneumonia, Bronchitis, URTI, and Tuberculosis, are mistakenly stated as \"not listed in the options\" despite their inclusion in the provided options. This error indicates a significant failure to effectively evaluate the evidence and options, leading to incorrect conclusions.\n\n3. The response does not adequately justify the final diagnosis of \"Influenza\" based on the provided symptoms and constraints. The evidence suggests no cough, fever, or other symptoms commonly associated with influenza, yet the response still favors this conclusion without compelling reasoning.\n\n4. The label \"URTI\" suggests that a different diagnosis was intended, yet the response does not engage directly with this possibility, failing to provide a contrastive evaluation or rejection justification.\n\nOverall, the response lacks the precision, evidence-based reasoning, and confident rejection of incorrect options expected for superior decision acumen. Therefore, it earns a \"No.\"\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
