Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 25\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your vaccinations up to date?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms more prominent at night?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Allergic sinusitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- GERD\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- URTI\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Influenza\\n- Stable angina\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe patient is a 25-year-old male with a burning pain in the lower chest.

    "prediction": "The initial response demonstrates poor decision-making. It incorrectly states that the patient experiences \"pain and difficulty in breathing when he exhales,\" which contradicts the provided information indicating no shortness of breath or wheezing upon exhalation. The decision process analyzes each condition's typical symptoms without clearly supporting why certain options align with or diverge from the input. It hastily concludes \"Unstable angina\" based on its association with chest pain without adequately deliberating why other likely conditions like bronchitis are less probable. The decision acumen lacks thoroughness and clarity, leading to a conclusion that contrasts with the correct label, 'Bronchitis.' All available evidence, including \"the absence of a cough,\" should have been more carefully accounted for, eliminating the potential missteps in logic and adherence to the evidence.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
