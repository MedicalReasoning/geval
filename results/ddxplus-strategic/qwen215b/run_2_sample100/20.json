Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 51\\nSex: M\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - pharynx\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- URTI\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 51-year-old male with no past history of similar symptoms, not attending or working in a daycare, no pain that relates to his reason for consultation, no tonsillitis, no thyroid cartilage, no pharynx pain, no pain radiating to another location, no precise pain location, no pain appearing suddenly, no smoking, no nasal congestion or clear runny nose, no cough, no travel in the last 4 weeks.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nViral pharyngitis: No tonsillitis or throat pain, fits poorly.\n\nBronchitis: No pharynx, fits poorly.\n\nAcute laryngitis: No tonsillitis or throat pain.\n\nURTIs: Fits poorly.\n\nPossible NSTEMI / STEMI: Fits poorly.\n\nUnstable angina: Fits poorly.\n\nStable angina: No symptoms.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is Viral pharyngitis.\n\n```Viral pharyngitis```\n\nLABEL:\nViral pharyngitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits poor decision-making in several key areas:\n\n1. Incorrect Interpretation of Input: The response inaccurately states that there is \"no pain\" related to the consultation reason and incorrectly summarizes the absence of tonsil, thyroid cartilage, and pharynx pain, distancing from the evidence that clearly indicates these sites have the pain with a high intensity of 8.\n\n2. Relevance and Accuracy: It fails to effectively tie the symptoms reported in the input (such as intense pain in specific areas like tonsil and pharynx) to the possible medical conditions listed in the options (especially conditions like Viral pharyngitis which commonly manifests with throat pain).\n\n3. Weak Conclusion and Justification: The conclusion drawn ('the most probable diagnosis is Viral pharyngitis') lacks a solid foundation grounded in the provided evidence, as the reasons listed in the analysis contradict the conclusion.\n\nOverall, the analysis lacks thoughtful deliberation, incorrectly simplifies and misunderstands the presented evidence, and altogether makes an incongruent decision regarding the possible diagnosis. The criteria for exceptional decision acumen, which requires separate invalid from valid options and offer a justified decision, are not met.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
