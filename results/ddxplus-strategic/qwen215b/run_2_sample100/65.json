Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 10\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - tugging\\n    - burning\\n    - sickening\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - hypochondrium(L)\\n    - belly\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - lower chest\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hiatal hernia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you think you are pregnant or are you currently pregnant?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently thrown up blood or something resembling coffee beans?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that get worse after eating?\\n    - N', 'options': '- GERD'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 10-year-old female with a sensitive, a knife stroke, and a burning sensation that starts in the stomach and goes up into the throat.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE contains multiple issues that compromise its decision acumen:\n\n1. The INITIAL RESPONSE appears confused. It states that the patient has \"a burning sensation that starts in the stomach and goes up into the throat,\" which actually contradicts the INPUT (\"Do you have a burning sensation...? - N\"). This indicates a misinterpretation or fabrication of symptoms not present in the input.\n\n2. The response fails to thoroughly evaluate the evidence and options provided in the INPUT. Although GERD is mentioned in both the options and conclusion, supporting reasoning is not clearly articulated based on the INPUT.\n\n3. There is a noticeable repetition and inconsistency about GERD being \"not typical for this age,\" but this reasoning doesn't seem to be grounded in the specifics of the INPUT provided. The conclusion also suggests GERD and attributing 'Burning sensation' incorrectly to it without linking it logically to the symptoms described.\n\n4. The INPUT has already negative responses for asthma, hiatal hernia, and pregnancy, which are ignored when the INITIAL RESPONSE suggests they could still be possible diagnoses.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity, correct interpretation, and logical reasoning which undermines its ability to make precise and accurate distinctions, resulting in poor decision-making quality.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
