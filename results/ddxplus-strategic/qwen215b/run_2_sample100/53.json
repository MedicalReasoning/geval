Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not demonstrate effective decision acumen for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of Symptoms**: The analysis begins by inaccurately summarizing the input data, such as stating the pain \"not severe\" which contradicts the input describing the pain intensity as 10/10. This shows a lack of precision in evaluating the evidence.\n\n2. **Incorrect Rejection of Key Symptoms**: The response mentions \"heartbreaking\" pain yet fails to illuminate why certain conditions like \"Spontaneous rib fracture\" might be relevant given the high pain intensity and specific pain localization, focusing instead on generalized characteristics without strong justification.\n\n3. **Weak Justification for Conclusion**: The conclusion of Bronchitis doesn’t align with the acute and severe chest pain described, with no supporting evidence from the given data or relevant characteristic matching. The pain isn’t linked to respiratory symptoms typical for Bronchitis. Additionally, the identified condition \"Spontaneous rib fracture,\" which matches acute sharp pain, is dismissed with negligible rationale.\n\n4. **Omissions and Lack of Deliberation**: The response lacks an articulated, systematic approach to narrowing down possibilities based on given symptoms and rejects potential conditions without evidenced reasoning. No logical pathway is evident in making a decision, showing a surface-level assessment rather than deep deliberation.\n\nBased on these observations, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not appropriately demonstrate strong, deliberate, and evidence-based decision-making acumen.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
