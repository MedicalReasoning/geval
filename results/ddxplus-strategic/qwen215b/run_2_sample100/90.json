Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 29\\nSex: M\\nHave any of your family members been diagnosed with cluster headaches?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - tugging\\n    - violent\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - eye(R)\\n    - eye(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel that your eyes produce excessive tears?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you take medication that dilates your blood vessels?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Cluster headache\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 29-year-old male with a history of cluster headaches.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not demonstrate strong decision acumen based on the available information from the INPUT. Firstly, it incorrectly states there is a history of cluster headaches, when the INPUT specifies there is no family history of cluster headaches, nor pain associated with cluster headaches. This indicates a failure in accurately interpreting the evidence. It also dismisses anemia without considering the symptoms presented, opting instead to state that it is not explicitly mentioned in the options, rather than critically evaluating the symptoms that could point towards or against this condition. Furthermore, Chagas is dismissed only by age, without a more thorough evaluation. The response fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation and precise distinction between valid and invalid options based on the INPUT, resulting in a lack of clarity and accuracy in decision-making.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
