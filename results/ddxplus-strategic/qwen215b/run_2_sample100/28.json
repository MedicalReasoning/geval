Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 10\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you immunosuppressed?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Influenza\\n- Pneumonia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 10-year-old girl with sore throat, cough, tonsil pain, and no fever.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates inadequate decision acumen. Here's why:\n\n1. **Inaccurate Information**: The response mentions \"with sore throat, cough, tonsil pain, and no fever.\" However, the INPUT specifies \"Do you have a cough? - N\" and \"Do you have a fever? - N.\" The mention of cough disregards the evidence provided, which was an outright 'No' to having a cough. This reflects inattention to detail.\n\n2. **Misalignment with INPUT**: The response overlooks the information stating the child does not have a cough, yet factors it into the decision-making process. \n\n3. **Lack of Rejection of Hard Negatives**: While the response does eventually settle on Viral pharyngitis, it does not explicitly reject other diagnoses like influenza based on the lack of fever and cough, both symptoms common for a flu diagnosis.\n\nThe initial response fails to make a decisive and clear distinction, rely on complete evidence from the input, and excludes consideration of hard negatives. There is a lack of grounded reasoning which misrepresents available information, thereby not demonstrating strong decision-making skills.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
