Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 23\\nSex: M\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 23-year-old male with no history of contact, no living with multiple people, no pain related to the reason for consulting, no sensitive/nerve pain, no tonsil, thyroid cartilage, or pharynx pain, no jaw pain, no radiating pain, no precise location, no speed of onset, no nasal congestion, no travel, and no signs of a heart problem.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE lists the symptoms as not including tonsil, thyroid cartilage, pharynx, or jaw pain, among others. However, the INPUT clearly states there is pain in these areas, with a high intensity rating of 7 for the pain located at these sites. Additionally, the INITIAL RESPONSE wrongly assesses the symptoms as consistent with NSTEMI/STEMI based on the information provided. The input does not suggest any signs or symptoms typically associated with heart conditions like NSTEMI or STEMI, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or other cardiovascular indicators. Additionally, the decision on viral pharyngitis dismisses key symptoms like sore throat that align more closely with the INPUT. This poorly aligned assessment indicates a significant discrepancy and lack of robust decision-making in distinguishing between the provided options based on input symptoms, as well as incorrect rejection of viral pharyngitis as a possibility.\n\nTherefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not demonstrate clear, precise, and effective decision-making. The conclusions drawn show poor alignment with the presented information, with inaccuracies and oversight in symptom assessment and diagnosis.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
