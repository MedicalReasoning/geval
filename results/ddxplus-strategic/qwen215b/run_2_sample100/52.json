Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 27\\nSex: F\\nAre you infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - sickening\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - biceps(R)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - thoracic spine\\n    - shoulder(R)\\n    - shoulder(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high cholesterol or do you take medications to treat high cholesterol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high blood pressure or do you take medications to treat high blood pressure?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a problem with poor circulation?\\n    - N\\nAre you feeling nauseous or do you feel like vomiting?\\n    - N\\nAre you a former smoker?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have close family members who had a cardiovascular disease problem before the age of 50?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- GERD\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- Chagas\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Panic attack\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 27-year-old female who is not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus and reports no pain or shortness of breath.

    "prediction": "The initial response does not effectively address the decision-making criteria outlined in the task. The response mentions that a 27-year-old female patient is experiencing no pain or shortness of breath, which contradicts the provided evidence indicating intense chest pain. The reasoning for ruling out some options as \"rare in this age group\" is flawed as these conditions are not age-specific. Additionally, the response dismisses NSTEMI / STEMI too quickly and incorrectly concludes Sarcoidosis as the most likely diagnosis without credible justification. The response lacks clarity, confidence, and thoughtful deliberation in differentiating between the provided options, and fails to provide valid reasons to reject or accept particular diagnoses based on the evidence.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
