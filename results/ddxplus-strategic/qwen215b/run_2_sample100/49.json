Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 51\\nSex: M\\nDo you regularly drink coffee or tea?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - a cramp\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - back of head\\n    - temple(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel lightheaded and dizzy or do you feel like you are about to faint?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently taken decongestants or other substances that may have stimulant effects?\\n    - N', 'options': '- PSVT\\n- Anemia\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Panic attack\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 51-year-old male who does not regularly drink coffee or tea and reports pain that feels like a cramp 8/10 on a scale of 0-10. He feels it is in his back of head and feels it radiates nowhere. The pain is 8/10 when located 8/10. He feels slightly dizzy 8/10 when experiencing the pain.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- PSVT: Non-specific, heart rhythm abnormalities not related to pain.\n\n- Anemia: Causes fatigue but not such a localized pain.\n\n- Atrial fibrillation: Causes palpitations but not the palpitations mentioned in the question.\n\n- Anaphylaxis: Severe, local to area of skin contact but not described as a cramp or headache.\n\n- Cluster headache: Severe localized pain but not described as a cramp.\n\n- Scombroid food poisoning: Possibility but not symptoms described.\n\n- Panic attack: Severe anxiety attack but not described as a cramp.\n\n- Chagas: Not a typical pain location.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is a cluster headache, with a localized headache that feels like a cramp.\n\n```Cluster headache```\n\nLABEL:\nPSVT\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits several issues in its decision-making process. Firstly, it incorrectly summarizes some of the symptoms and details provided in the INPUT. For example, it suggests that the pain is a \"cramp 8/10,\" which appears to be a misinterpretation because the characteristics and intensity of pain are provided separately. Secondly, the response unnecessarily ranks symptoms as numeric scales, likely confusing the interpretation. Thirdly, some of the dismissals of other conditions, such as addressing dizziness with a numeric value when there was a clear \"N\" response in the INPUT, were not accurately reflected.\n\nMoreover, it does not seem to use thorough reasoning to correctly align its diagnosis with the givens in the INPUT or defend its rejection against the right option, which is PSVT based on the LABEL. The reasoning for dismissing PSVT as \"Non-specific, heart rhythm abnormalities not related to pain,\" is not well justified, since it appears that more critical analysis of symptoms connected to cardiovascular issues, particularly under specific described scenarios, was required.\n\nConsequently, the decisions were not precise, and the response failed to identify key details, misaligned symptoms, and made an incorrect final choice.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
