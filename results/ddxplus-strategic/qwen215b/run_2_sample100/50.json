Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 16\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain that improves when you lean forward?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - side of the neck(R)\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you regularly take stimulant drugs?\\n    - N\\nDo you have difficulty swallowing, or have a feeling of discomfort/blockage when swallowing?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that you produce more saliva than usual?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America\\nHave you noticed that the tone of your voice has become deeper, softer or hoarse?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Epiglottitis\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Larygospasm\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Chagas\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Viral pharyngitis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nAn 16-year-old male with pain that improves with leaning forward, related to his reason for consulting, and pain in the tonsil, side of the neck, pharynx, under the jaw, and tonsil. Pain is a knife stroke intensity, does not radiate, located 5 out of 10, and appears 3 out of 10. He does not take stimulant drugs, feels comfortable swallowing, experiences shortness of breath, has diabetes, rarely produces saliva, breathes through a high-pitched sound, has not traveled outside the U.S., and has a hoarse tone of voice.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nEpiglottitis: Pain improves with leaning forward, associated with throat pain and difficulty swallowing.\n\nMyasthenia gravis: Pain described, but typically affects the face and leads to difficulty swallowing.\n\nAcute laryngitis: Pain can improve with leaning forward, but not often.\n\nHIV (initial infection): Not typical symptoms.\n\nLarygospasm: Pain and associated breathing difficulties, but not leaning forward.\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Not typical symptoms.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome: Pain improves with leaning forward, but not often.\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Pain can improve with leaning forward, but not often.\n\nMyocarditis: Pain and difficulty breathing can be associated, but with no fever and no other symptoms.\n\nChagas: Not typical symptoms.\n\nPulmonary embolism: Not typical symptoms.\n\nScombroid food poisoning: Not typical symptoms.\n\nPSVT: Not typical symptoms.\n\nSLE: Not typical symptoms.\n\nAnaphylaxis: Pain improves with leaning forward, but not often.\n\nViral pharyngitis: Pain described, but often happens with fever and difficulty swallowing.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is Viral pharyngitis.\n\n```Viral pharyngitis```\n\nLABEL:\nEpiglottitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The Initial Response demonstrates poor decision-making, showing imprecise conclusions and a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information effectively, given the evidence in the INPUT.\n\n1. It incorrectly summarizes some INPUT details, claiming \"pain that improves with leaning forward\" when the evidence explicitly states the opposite: \"Do you have pain that improves when you lean forward?\\n - N\".\n2. It also misstates other important information. For instance, \"experiences shortness of breath\" should be noted as \"N\" for no.\n3. The reasoning for all conditions is shallow and fails to leverage the INPUT methodically to reject incorrect diagnoses decisively. It doesn't effectively link symptoms to suggested conditions using a logical approach or address negative evidence.\n4. It concludes with Viral pharyngitis without thorough justification or rejection based on expected symptoms like fever or difficulty swallowing, which are stated as absent.\n\n\nThe conclusion made does not follow from a robust analysis of the provided information and fails to decisively and appropriately eliminate or validate options as would be expected. Therefore, it does not demonstrate exceptional decision acumen.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
