Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 70\\nSex: M\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - pharynx\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 70-year-old male without a fever, cough, travel history, or symptoms of other known conditions (bronchitis, laryngitis, pneumonia, or chest pain). He has no tonsillar symptoms, pharyngeal pain, jaw pain, or a region of pain sensitive to touch. The pain is described as \"sensitive to touch,\" not \"burning.\" The pain is not localized to any specific part of the throat or jaw (no right or left tonsillar region), it appears quickly (not \"worsening over time\"), and intensity is not specified. Pain is not felt (no \"no fever\" or \"no cough\"). The patient does not have a travel history.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- Bronchitis: Not mentioned.\n- Acute laryngitis: Not related to sensitivity or sensitivity to touch.\n- Tuberculosis: Not mentioned.\n- Viral pharyngitis: Not mentioned.\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI: Not mentioned.\n- Unstable angina: Not mentioned.\n\nThe patient's symptoms suggest possible acute laryngitis, not likely to be bronchitis or laryngitis, and ruled out for acute laryngitis (not sensitive, not burning, not localized to throat, not identified tonsillar or pharyngeal involvement). The patient does not have a travel history and is not feverish. No cough. Acute laryngitis is a less likely diagnosis compared to other options. The patient's history fits more closely with a viral pharyngitis, which is less likely to be caused by an infection.\n\n```Viral pharyngitis```\n\nLABEL:\nViral pharyngitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE appears to make several missteps in decision-making:\n\n1. The response confusingly claims \"not likely to be bronchitis or laryngitis,\" then later suggests a possible diagnosis of \"acute laryngitis,\" which is inconsistent and shows a lack of clarity.\n   \n2. The analysis contradicts the evidence related to pain type, stating the pain is \"not burning\" whereas the input lists both \"sensitive\" and \"burning\" as pain descriptors.\n   \n3. The response fails to appropriately dismiss hard negatives or invalid conditions logically. For instance, acute laryngitis is initially marked as less likely, yet considered contradictorily.\n\n4. The conclusion of \"viral pharyngitis\" is made without explicit justification that aligns with the listed patient evidence, which impacts the decision's confidence and clarity.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks precise and confident decision-making, evidenced by contradictions and unsupported conclusions. It does not meet the criterion for a decisive and well-supported diagnostic choice.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
