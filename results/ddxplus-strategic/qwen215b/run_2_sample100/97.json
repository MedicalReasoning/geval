Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 67\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - upper chest\\n    - pharynx\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your vaccinations up to date?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- URTI\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- GERD\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Panic attack\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Stable angina\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 67-year-old female with a sore throat, cough, and shortness of breath.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE makes several errors in evaluating the available information, which affects its decision acumen:\n\n1. The initial response incorrectly identifies the patient as having a sore throat, cough, and shortness of breath, whereas the evidence indicates the opposite for these symptoms.\n2. It incorrectly states that there is no pain in several locations when the evidence indicates low-intensity pain in areas including the chest, pharynx, and posterior chest wall.\n3. The response does not address how these observations relate to the diagnoses beyond listing a series of generalized likelihoods without evidence-based justification specific to the patient.\n4. It fails to reject several options based on the evidence provided. For example, it lists GERD as \"not typical,\" which contradicts the presence of chest-related pain that could be indicative of GERD.\n\nOverall, the decision acumen displayed in the INITIAL RESPONSE is poor. The response fails to use the evidences thoroughly to make precise distinctions and does not ground its conclusions well in the available evidence. Due to these issues, the conclusion drawn (URTI) lacks strong justification and does not appropriately reject other options that might align better with the provided symptoms, such as the correct label of Bronchitis.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
