Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 2\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - pharynx\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Influenza\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Allergic sinusitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- URTI\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Croup\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 2-year-old male with a burning pain on the side of the chest.

    "prediction": "The initial response does not demonstrate strong decision-making acumen. The response lists options and provides commentary on each one, but it includes some inaccuracies and lacks clarity in distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant options. The statement \"Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation: Not typically seen in children\" is incorrect since asthma exacerbations can commonly occur in young children. \"Influenza: Common in adults\" disregards that influenza is also common in children. Furthermore, the conclusion drawn (\"The most likely diagnosis for this patient is Viral pharyngitis.\") is not well supported by the evidence provided, such as the absence of a cough or other respiratory symptoms typically associated with viral pharyngitis. The conclusion fails to robustly consider the possibility of bronchitis, which aligns with the presence of chest pain and its potentially inflammatory nature. More importantly, the initial response does not confidently reject the incorrect options with sound justification. Overall, the initial response demonstrates weak decision-making due to an unclear approach to weighing evidence.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
