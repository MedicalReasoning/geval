Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 59\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - mouth\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - nose\\n    - eye(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - back of head\\n    - nose\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you lost your sense of smell?\\n    - N\\nHave you had a cold in the last 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have polyps in your nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you have greenish or yellowish nasal discharge?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your vaccinations up to date?\\n    - N\\nAre you more likely to develop common allergies than the general population?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 59-year-old female with mouth, cheek, nose, eye pain, fever, loss of smell, past history of polyps, asthma, green nasal discharge, and no recent travel.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAcute rhinosinusitis: Severe, possibly accompanied by fever.\n\nChronic rhinosinusitis: Usually non-severe.\n\nAcute laryngitis: Larynx pain, not nose.\n\nChagas: Rare in developed countries and not often associated with nasal symptoms.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is Acute rhinosinusitis.\n\n```Acute rhinosinusitis```\n\nLABEL:\nAcute rhinosinusitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE has several inaccuracies and inconsistencies with the INPUT data provided. The input specifies that the patient does not have a fever, loss of smell, past history of polyps, asthma, or green nasal discharge. On the contrary, the INITIAL RESPONSE inaccurately states these symptoms as present. Additionally, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not effectively distinguish between the valid options and fails to reject incorrect ones based on the given evidences. It inaccurately concludes Acute rhinosinusitis without appropriately weighing evidence or ruling out other options like Chronic rhinosinusitis, which also involves nasal issues but is usually less severe. The analysis lacks depth and precision, leading to an incorrect conclusion with an ungrounded rationale.\n\nThus, the Decision Acumen here is weak, leading to a rating of \"No\".\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
