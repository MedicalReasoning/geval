Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 66\\nSex: M\\nDo you feel anxious?\\n    - N\\nDo any members of your immediate family have a psychiatric illness?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a cramp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\n    - hypochondrium(L)\\n    - breast(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with depression?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from chronic anxiety?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel lightheaded and dizzy or do you feel like you are about to faint?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had numbness, loss of sensation or tingling, in both arms and legs and around your mouth?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Panic attack\\n- PSVT\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Stable angina\\n- Anemia\\n- GERD\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Inguinal hernia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- SLE\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 66-year-old male reports feeling anxious, with a cramp-like pain in the right side of the chest. He does not have any immediate family members with psychiatric illnesses. Pain is described as a \"cramp,\" not a typical anatomic site, and the intensity is rated at 3. Pain does not radiate. The location is described as the side of the chest, not the iliac fossa or hypochondrium, which are more typical sites of thoracic pain. There is no history of shortness of breath. He denies a history of depression or chronic anxiety, but mentions feeling lightheaded and dizzy. He does not have numbness or tingling in the arms and legs. No recent travel history. He denies a history of asthma or bronchodilator use, and there is no history of anemia, pericarditis, or unstable angina. No recent experience with chest pain or dizziness, and no history of unstable angina. The anterior wall of the inferior myocardial infarction (STEMI) criteria are not met. The radiographic features of pulmonary embolism are not present. The patient has no history of sarcoidosis, pan- or chagasic disease, or Guillain-Barré syndrome. He does not have a history of GERD, atrial fibrillation, inguinal hernia, or boerhaave's reaction. The patient has not traveled internationally in the last four weeks.

It fails to accurately differentiate between the symptoms of the conditions listed in the options and the symptomatology provided in the INPUT, resulting in an incorrect and unsupported choice.
