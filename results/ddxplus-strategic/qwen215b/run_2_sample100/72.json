Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 51\\nSex: M\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high blood pressure or do you take medications to treat high blood pressure?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known heart defect?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating very irregularly or in a disorganized pattern?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Atrial fibrillation'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 51-year-old male with no known history of heart issues, high blood pressure, a heart attack or angina, no heart defect, no palpitations, no heart racing, no irregular heartbeats, no travel history.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Fits history.\n\n```Atrial fibrillation```\n\nLABEL:\nAtrial fibrillation\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE in this evaluation task fails to demonstrate strong decision-making skills. The user provides a clear list of negative answers to relevant health questions, and yet the INITIAL RESPONSE inaccurately concludes that atrial fibrillation fits the history, suggesting a lack of logical assessment of the inputs. Atrial fibrillation is typically connected to positive indicators such as previous heart issues or irregular heartbeats, none of which are present in the user's data. The response lacks clarity and precision, as it does not provide justification or reasoning grounded in the INPUT. Furthermore, it accepts the diagnosis without adequately rejecting the lack of evidence for it based on the user's medical history.\n\nConsidering this, the decision is imprecise and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\n\nPREDICTION: ```PREDICTION```No```"
