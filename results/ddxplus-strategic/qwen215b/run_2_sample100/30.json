Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 19\\nSex: M\\nDo you have an active cancer?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - upper chest\\n    - scapula(R)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - breast(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nHave you been unable to move or get up for more than 3 consecutive days within the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have swelling in one or more areas of your body?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - posterior aspect of the ankle(R)\\n    - calf(R)\\n    - calf(L)\\nHave you had surgery within the last month?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Panic attack\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 19-year-old male with coughing up blood and an unknown reason for his pain.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making skills based on the INPUT provided. \n\nFirstly, the response contains inaccuracies from the beginning, mentioning \"coughing up blood\" despite the INPUT clearly stating the patient is not coughing up blood. This misinterpretation of the evidence immediately undermines the decision-making process, as it leads to incorrect consideration and elimination of diagnostic options. \n\nFurthermore, the response lacks a thorough evaluation of critical evidence provided in the INPUT, such as the location, nature, and intensity of the pain, as well as other vital signs and symptoms. Additionally, it does not adequately differentiate or compare the listed options against the given symptoms. \n\nThe ultimate conclusion made by the response, \"Acute dystonic reactions,\" appears arbitrary and unsupported by the patient evidence detailed in the INPUT. The chosen diagnosis does not align with the symptoms and dismissed other potentially relevant diagnostic options without sufficient rationale.\n\nOverall, the evaluation lacks clarity, precision, and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation, thus demonstrating weak decision-making acumen.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
