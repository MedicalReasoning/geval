Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 43\\nSex: F\\nHave you ever had a diagnosis of anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any family members who have been diagnosed with anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tugging\\n    - a cramp\\n    - exhausting\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - back of head\\n    - forehead\\n    - temple(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nDo you have chronic kidney failure?\\n    - N\\nDo you have very abundant or very long menstruation periods?\\n    - N\\nAre you taking any new oral anticoagulants ((NOACs)?\\n    - N\\nDo you think you are pregnant or are you currently pregnant?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed light red blood or blood clots in your stool?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nIs your BMI less than 18.5, or are you underweight?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Anemia\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myocarditis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 43-year-old female with lack of family history for anemia, no pain at the moment, and no significant location or intensity of the pain.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE lacks decision acumen according to the provided criterion. The reasoning provided in the response is insufficient and inaccurate in some aspects. It mistakenly states \"A 43-year-old female with lack of family history for anemia, no pain at the moment, and no significant location or intensity of the pain,\" despite the input evidence indicating the presence of specific pain (back of head, forehead, temple) with an intensity level of 4. Moreover, the conclusion that the most probable diagnosis is \"Anemia\" isn't well-supported, given that there are no indications of blood or systemic symptoms typical of anemia. The response fails to thoroughly and accurately assess the symptoms against the conditions listed in the options, yielding an incorrect conclusion without adequate justification based on the provided evidence.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
