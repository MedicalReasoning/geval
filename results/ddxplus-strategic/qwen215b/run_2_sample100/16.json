Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

The response misinterprets the patient's symptoms and evidence, such as stating \"increased sweating\" and \"pain in the right side of the chest,\" when the input clearly states the patient does not have increased sweating and has pain on the left side of the chest. Additionally, the response inaccurately asserts past medical history like panic attacks and anemia, which are not indicated in the input. The evaluation of possible diagnoses is vague, overgeneralized, and some are arbitrarily dismissed as \"not specific enough\" without meaningful justification derived from the input. Finally, the concluded diagnosis, \"Possible NSTEMI / STEMI,\" does not align with the provided information. The response lacks precision and the decision-making process is flawed due to erroneous interpretations and unjustified conclusions.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
