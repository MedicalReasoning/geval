Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 73\\nSex: F\\nDo you have a poor diet?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a diagnosis of anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any family members who have been diagnosed with anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tugging\\n    - exhausting\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - temple(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel so tired that you are unable to do your usual activities or are you stuck in your bed all day long?\\n    - N\\nDo you constantly feel fatigued or do you have non-restful sleep?\\n    - N\\nDo you have chronic kidney failure?\\n    - N\\nAre you taking any new oral anticoagulants ((NOACs)?\\n    - N\\nIs your skin much paler than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you think you are pregnant or are you currently pregnant?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North Africa\\nIs your BMI less than 18.5, or are you underweight?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Anemia\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Chagas\\n- Cluster headache\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- SLE\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 73-year-old female with a history of anemia and pain mostly in the temple region, characterized as \"tugging\" and \"exhausting\", with no radiating pain.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making for several reasons:\n\n1. **Incorrect Evidence Reference**: The response mistakenly states the patient has a \"history of anemia,\" while the input explicitly states \"Have you ever had a diagnosis of anemia? - N\" and \"Do any family members have anemia? - N\", which indicates no history of anemia.\n\n2. **Pains not Anemia-Related**: The response incorrectly concludes that Anemia is the most likely diagnosis. However, anemia is generally associated with symptoms like fatigue, paleness (none of which are reported), and not localized non-severe pain, especially in the temple region without severe associated symptoms. The pain is described as low intensity and with no radiation, which isn't typically characteristic of anemia.\n\n3. **Distinguishing Valid from Invalid Options**: The response fails to accurately reject options based on the relevant negatives provided. It concludes \"Anemia\" is likely without considering the specific evidence against it from the input.\n\n4. **Failure to Justify Rejections**: While the response lists options and dismisses them, it does not thoroughly justify each rejection with reference to the input data, relying instead on generalized notions of what the conditions entail.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks precise decision-making and fails to justify its conclusions properly with the input details. Therefore, the response should be rated as not meeting the criterion of effective decision-making.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
