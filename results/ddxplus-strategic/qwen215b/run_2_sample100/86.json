Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 57\\nSex: F\\nHave you been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known heart defect?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating very irregularly or in a disorganized pattern?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that are increased with physical exertion but alleviated with rest?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Atrial fibrillation\\n- PSVT\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Panic attack\\n- Anemia\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 57-year-old female without known heart valve issues, COPD, or previous heart issues, who experienced shortness of breath and slight dizziness.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provides an analysis of the patient's symptoms and a step-by-step evaluation of the potential diagnoses based on the INPUT provided. However, there are several inaccuracies and misinterpretations in this analysis:\n\n1. The initial response mistakenly assumes the patient experiences shortness of breath, slight dizziness, and irregular heartbeats, which contradicts the INPUT information, all of which states \"N\" (No) to these symptoms.\n2. The response fails to definitively eliminate options based on the symptoms because it inaccurately interprets the symptom context. For example, it suggests a panic attack as the most likely diagnosis despite the absence of typical symptoms.\n3. The initial response does not recognize the significance of the given symptoms concerning atrial fibrillation, which was labeled as the correct answer.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks precise deliberation and fails to correctly interpret the provided information and symptoms, leading to an incorrect conclusion.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
