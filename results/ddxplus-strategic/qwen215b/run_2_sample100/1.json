Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 50\\nSex: M\\nDo you feel anxious?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a cramp\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - flank(L)\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\n    - hypochondrium(R)\\n    - pubis\\n    - belly\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with depression?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from chronic anxiety?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel lightheaded and dizzy or do you feel like you are about to faint?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a migraine or is a member of your family known to have migraines?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are dying or were you afraid that you were about do die?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nAre you feeling nauseous or do you feel like vomiting?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had numbness, loss of sensation or tingling, in both arms and legs and around your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel like you are detached from your own body or your surroundings?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a head trauma?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Panic attack\\n- PSVT\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Anemia\\n- Boerhaave\\n- GERD\\n- Inguinal hernia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 50-year-old man with significant anxiety, sweating, and pain in the right flank mentions the \"cramp\" pain.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE fails the Decision Acumen criterion based on the provided Task Description. The response incorrectly summarizes the input data, asserting there's \"significant anxiety, sweating, and pain\" when the subject explicitly denies anxiety and sweating. It also mentions numbness and tingling and suspects the pain \"in the right flank\" was described as \"cramp,\" which doesn't align with the input. Furthermore, the INITIAL RESPONSE speculates about numbness, tingling, and other conditions not supported by the input data.\n\nThe thoroughness of the analysis is compromised due to these assumptions and inaccuracies. Although a conclusion is eventually reached, it is based on misinterpretations and irrelevant considerations, lacking logical alignment with the input data. Instead of identifying the correct option of \"Panic attack,\" the decision incorrectly concludes an \"Inguinal hernia\" is the most likely diagnosis, despite no symptoms aligning with such a conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the unclear distinctions among the conditions and the incorrect final decision lead this INITIAL RESPONSE to fail the Decision Acumen criterion.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
