Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 3\\nSex: F\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you take corticosteroids?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - tugging\\n    - heavy\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - ankle(R)\\n    - ankle(L)\\n    - thigh(R)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(R)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHave you gained weight recently?\\n    - N\\nDo you have heart failure?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have liver cirrhosis?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had surgery to remove lymph nodes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have swelling in one or more areas of your body?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - ankle(L)\\n    - thigh(R)\\n    - thigh(L)\\n    - sole(R)\\n    - sole(L)\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known kidney problem resulting in an inability to retain proteins?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Localized edema\\n- Chagas\\n- Anaphylaxis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 3-year-old female with no history, no corticosteroid use, no pain related to her condition, no swelling, and no surgery.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE begins by summarizing the key details from the INPUT but introduces inaccuracies in doing so. It incorrectly states \"no swelling\" despite the INPUT indicating swelling in specified locations, such as ankles and thighs. This is a significant oversight and affects the decision-making process. \n\nIn evaluating the options, the response mentions that Localized edema is \"not likely for a child,\" which contradicts the ultimate choice of this option without clear justification or consideration of the swelling mentioned. The rationale for rejecting Chagas and Anaphylaxis is not thoroughly supported by the INPUT or logical reasoning, other than noting these are less common in children. \n\nThe decision lacks confidence and precision due to these inconsistencies and fails to clarify why Localized edema was ultimately chosen despite noting it was initially unlikely. Therefore, the initial response does not exhibit exceptional decision acumen as it makes imprecise conclusions and fails to consider all relevant information accurately.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
