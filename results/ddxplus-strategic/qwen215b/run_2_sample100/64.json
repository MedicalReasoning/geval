Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 64\\nSex: M\\nDo you have metastatic cancer?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heartbreaking\\n    - haunting\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - violent\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - upper chest\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nAre you being treated for osteoporosis?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nDo you have intense coughing fits?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased with movement?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Whooping cough\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Boerhaave\\n- GERD\\n- Stable angina\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThis patient is 64 years old with metastatic cancer, no pain, and a pain characterized as a \"heartbreaking.\" He does not feel pain in specific locations like chest, side, or upper.

    "prediction": "The Initial Response misinterpreted or overlooked crucial information from the INPUT, leading to an inaccurate conclusion. The INPUT states that the patient does not have metastatic cancer, contrary to what's mentioned at the beginning of the response. Additionally, the response incorrectly states there is no specific location of pain when in fact, there are multiple locations identified, such as the lower chest, side of the chest, and upper chest. There also seems to be a confusion in the description of pain, indexing it as \"no pain\" when the intensity is documented at 6. These errors contribute to an imprecise decision-making process which undermines the confidence in identifying \"Spontaneous rib fracture\" as a plausible diagnosis. \n\nTherefore, the Initial Response exhibits poor decision-making with imprecise conclusions and weak distinctions between valid and invalid options. The response does not thoroughly evaluate the available information and fails to confidently reject incorrect options or justify its reasoning.\n\nPREDICTION: ```PREDICTION```No```"
