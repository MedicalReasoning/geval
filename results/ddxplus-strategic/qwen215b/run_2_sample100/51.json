Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 17\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pericarditis\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- PSVT\\n- GERD\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Panic attack\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 17-year-old female with a pain characterized as a knife stroke in the breast (L side) with a sharpness, rated 4 out of 10 on a scale from 0 to 10. The pain does not radiate, is not precise, and does not appear suddenly. She feels no shortness of breath, is not experiencing palpitations, has not traveled recently, and the pain is not worse when lying down.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE is flawed in terms of decision acumen for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of Evidence**: The initial response misinterprets the symptom data. While the evidence mentions that pain does radiate (to both sides of the posterior chest wall), the initial response claims the pain does not radiate. This directly conflicts with the input evidence and affects the accuracy of subsequent analysis.\n\n2. **Incorrect Symptom Matching**: The initial response bases the initial condition on incorrect symptoms, stating misconceptions about which symptoms are associated with panic attacks as opposed to pericarditis. The sharp pain and its location, according to the input, could align with pericarditis, as was verified by actual labels.\n\n3. **Logical Gaps in Deliberation**: The response failed to systematically evaluate each condition against all the available symptoms. Instead, it jumped to conclusions about several conditions without sufficiently justified rationale, as evidenced by the wrongful ruling out of pericarditis, which was the labeled condition.\n\n4. **Failure to Correctly Rank Diagnoses**: The conclusion, a panic attack, is not rigorously supported by the evidence, especially considering it rules out pericarditis based on a misunderstanding and offers panic attack based on sudden sharp pain and ignoring the age irrelevance pointed out with PSVT among others.\n\nConsidering these points, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not demonstrate strong decision acumen; it reflects weak evaluation skills, misinterpretation, and insufficient reasoning which does not align with the given input and label.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
