Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 39\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed any new fatigue, generalized and vague discomfort, diffuse (widespread) muscle aches or a change in your general well-being related to your consultation today?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pericarditis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Myocarditis\\n- GERD\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- PSVT\\n- Panic attack\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Chagas\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 39-year-old female with pain (a knife stroke) in the right breast (L), feeling it, not radiating, not precise, and not fast.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE evaluates the given options against the symptoms but does not showcase strong decision acumen. While it correctly considers some symptoms and rules out several diagnoses such as pericarditis, it inaccurately assesses some medical conditions and their symptoms. For example, it mistakenly lists \"Right-sided heart failure\" under acute pulmonary edema, which is unrelated. Also, it incorrectly concludes \"Panic attack\" without strong supporting reasons from the INPUT or rejecting the correct label, Myocarditis, effectively. The decision-making process lacks a thorough justification that aligns with the evidence provided in the INPUT. Thus, the decision-making shows imprecise conclusions and weak distinctions, providing insufficient reasoning for the final diagnosis.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
