Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 23\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain that improves when you lean forward?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the neck(R)\\n    - side of the neck(L)\\n    - palace\\n    - under the jaw\\n    - trachea\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have difficulty swallowing, or have a feeling of discomfort/blockage when swallowing?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high blood pressure or do you take medications to treat high blood pressure?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that you produce more saliva than usual?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your vaccinations up to date?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Epiglottitis\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Larygospasm\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Stable angina\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Chagas\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 23-year-old female with pain that improves when leaning forward, pain in the neck (right) and side of the neck, pain sensation, difficulty swallowing, no fever, no high blood pressure, no exposure to infectious risk factors, no respiratory symptoms, no recent travel, and no symptoms of diabetes, alcohol use, or vaccinations.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nEpiglottitis: No symptoms of respiratory infection.\n\nMyasthenia gravis: Not clear from the symptoms.\n\nPossible NSTEMI / STEMI: Cardiovascular symptoms don't fit.\n\nUnstable angina: Similar symptoms but not severe enough.\n\nHIV (initial infection): HIV symptoms don't fit.\n\nLarygospasm: Can cause pain but not severe.\n\nAcute pulmonary edema: Sudden onset.\n\nStable angina: Typical presentation, not severe.\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Not clear from symptoms.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome: No symptoms.\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Pain from a toxin.\n\nCardiac conditions: Not severe enough.\n\nSLE: Not clear from symptoms.\n\nPulmonary embolism: Chest pain.\n\nScombroid food poisoning: No flavor or smell.\n\nPSVT: Not clear from symptoms.\n\nChagas: No symptoms.\n\nPulmonary embolism: Chest pain.\n\nPSVT and Chagas are similar symptoms but not clear from the symptoms.\n\nLarygospasm and Acute dystonic reactions are not severe enough.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is Acute pulmonary edema.\n\n```Acute pulmonary edema```\n\nLABEL:\nEpiglottitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clear decision acumen based on the provided criterion. The reasoning provided in the INITIAL RESPONSE is not concise, precise, or grounded well in the INPUT provided. Let's go through some of the issues:\n\n1. The description of the patient's condition is inaccurate: The INPUT specifically notes that pain does not improve when leaning forward and the presence of pain was denied (\"Do you have pain that improves when you lean forward? - N\" and \"Do you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting? - N\"). Hence, the INITIAL RESPONSE makes incorrect assumptions based on incorrect interpretation.\n\n2. Incorrect Information Processing: The INITIAL RESPONSE states \"pain in the neck (right) and side of the neck\", however, the INPUT evidenced multi-locations such as side of the neck, under the jaw, and trachea. There is a failure to consolidate and evaluate effectively.\n\n3. Incorrect Decision Conclusion: The INITIAL RESPONSE determines the probable diagnosis is \"Acute pulmonary edema\" despite contradicting evidence against respiratory symptoms and the emphatic rejection within the INPUT. The conclusion directly conflicts with provided inputs like no respiratory symptoms and no sudden pain onset symptoms.\n\n4. Weak Rejection of Negatives: The INITIAL RESPONSE inadequately considers evidences against diseases like Epiglottitis which was given as the LABEL. There is a lack of significant rejection of incorrect options like Epiglottitis which involves conditions the INITIAL RESPONSE notes such as \"no respiratory symptoms\".\n\nOverall, the decisions and conclusions made within INITIAL RESPONSE do not clearly demonstrate effective decision making, instead relying on poorly derived conclusions and ignored evidence from the INPUT.\n\nPREDICTION: ```PREDICTION```No```"
