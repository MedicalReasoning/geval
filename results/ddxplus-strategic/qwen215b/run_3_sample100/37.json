Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 64\\nSex: M\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - pharynx\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that the tone of your voice has become deeper, softer or hoarse?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Influenza'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 64-year-old man describing his pain as burning, located in the tonsils, feels in the pharynx, is not radiating, is precise, and appears sudden.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE makes several logical evaluations based on the provided evidence but ultimately arrives at an incorrect conclusion. Here's a breakdown of the decision-making in the response:\n\n1. The response methodically reviews each potential diagnosis against the symptoms and history provided in the INPUT.\n2. It correctly identifies symptoms associated with some conditions - for example, Influenza is correctly associated with cough, fever, and throat pain.\n3. However, the response fails to adequately consider all implications of the symptoms given for Acute laryngitis. The user has normal voice tone, which seems to have led to a rejection of laryngitis, whereas Acute laryngitis could initially manifest without voice changes or with subsequent development, potentially applicable in this case.\n4. While it does reject some conditions appropriately, the response lacks a thorough evaluation of the relationship between presented symptoms and Acute laryngitis, and hastily concludes with Viral pharyngitis.\n\nOverall, while the decision process is somewhat structured, it fails to arrive at the correct label due to oversight in considering the full clinical picture for Acute laryngitis. The judgment is not precise, as it needs a more robust connection between symptoms and the correct diagnosis, reflecting a lapse in decision acumen.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
