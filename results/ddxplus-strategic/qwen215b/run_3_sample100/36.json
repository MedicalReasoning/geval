Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 10\\nSex: F\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDid your cheeks suddenly turn red?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any lesions, redness or problems on your skin that you believe are related to the condition you are consulting for?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - pink\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - N\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - biceps(R)\\n    - biceps(L)\\n    - mouth\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - ankle(R)\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - Y\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you feeling nauseous or do you feel like vomiting?\\n    - N\\nDid you eat dark-fleshed fish (such as tuna) or Swiss cheese before the reaction occurred?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 10-year-old with shortness of breath and difficulty breathing, and a red skin lesion.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly interprets the INPUT regarding the symptoms and conditions. The input states that the individual is not experiencing shortness of breath or breathing difficulty in a significant way, contrary to what is mentioned in the Initial Response. Furthermore, the INITIAL RESPONSE concludes that the most likely diagnosis is Scombroid food poisoning, but incorrectly states the conditions' relevance to shortness of breath. The response also incorrectly claims that a red skin lesion was present, despite the INPUT actually describing a pink rash. There is a lack of coherent reasoning and accuracy in evaluating the symptoms and aligning them with the diagnoses presented. Therefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits poor decision-making, as it does not accurately evaluate or reject incorrect diagnoses based on the evidence.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
