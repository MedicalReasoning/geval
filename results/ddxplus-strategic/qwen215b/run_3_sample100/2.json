Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 43\\nSex: F\\nHave you ever had a diagnosis of anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any family members who have been diagnosed with anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tugging\\n    - a cramp\\n    - exhausting\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - back of head\\n    - forehead\\n    - temple(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nDo you have chronic kidney failure?\\n    - N\\nDo you have very abundant or very long menstruation periods?\\n    - N\\nAre you taking any new oral anticoagulants ((NOACs)?\\n    - N\\nDo you think you are pregnant or are you currently pregnant?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed light red blood or blood clots in your stool?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nIs your BMI less than 18.5, or are you underweight?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Anemia\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myocarditis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 43-year-old female with lack of family history for anemia, no pain at the moment, and no significant location or intensity of the pain.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making due to several factors:\n\n1. Lack of Logical Reasoning: The response concludes with \"The most probable diagnosis is Anemia\" without providing a clear rationale for this choice. It does not explain why the other conditions were dismissed or why Anemia was selected, especially when the input explicitly states the absence of anemia signs.\n\n2. Incorrect Evaluation: The input specifies no previous history or symptoms of anemia, yet the response selects it as the diagnosis, ignoring the available evidence against it.\n\n3. Failure to Reject Hard Negatives: The response does not decisively reject incorrect options like Anemia, which should be easily dismissed based on the input evidence. Similarly, it does not clearly eliminate other conditions like Acute pulmonary edema or Guillain-Barré syndrome, which do not match the symptoms described in the input.\n\nOverall, the decision-making is not thorough or precise, and the chosen diagnosis does not align with the input details. Therefore, the response fails to demonstrate decision acumen as defined by the criterion.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
