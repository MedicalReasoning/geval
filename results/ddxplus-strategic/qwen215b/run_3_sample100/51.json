Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 17\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pericarditis\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- PSVT\\n- GERD\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Panic attack\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 17-year-old female with a pain characterized as a knife stroke in the breast (L side) with a sharpness, rated 4 out of 10 on a scale from 0 to 10. The pain does not radiate, is not precise, and does not appear suddenly. She feels no shortness of breath, is not experiencing palpitations, has not traveled recently, and the pain is not worse when lying down. The pain is alleviated when sitting up.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- Pericarditis: Uncommon in this age and gender, and the symptoms don't match.\n\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax: Occurs in the chest, not the breast.\n\n- Pulmonary embolism: Can cause shortness of breath and chest pain.\n\n- PSVT: Not common in this age.\n\n- GERD: Possible but not a sharp, localized pain.\n\n- Atrial fibrillation: Causes palpitations but not shortness of breath.\n\n- Myocarditis: Typically causes symptoms like fever and chest pain.\n\n- Panic attack: Fit with the sudden onset and sharp pain.\n\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome: Can cause sharp pain but not in the breast.\n\n- Boerhaave: Rare but not sharp pain.\n\n- Scombroid food poisoning: Not sharp and not in the breast.\n\n- Acute dystonic reactions: Not sharp.\n\n- Myasthenia gravis: Can cause pain but not in the breast.\n\n- Anemia: Not sharp.\n\n- Sarcoidosis: Not sharp.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is Panic attack.\n\n```Panic attack```\n\nLABEL:\nPericarditis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE did not demonstrate strong decision-making skills. It inaccurately summarizes several key details from the INPUT: \n\n1. **Inaccurate symptom description**: The response claims the pain does not radiate, when in fact, the INPUT specifies the pain radiates to both sides of the posterior chest wall.\n2. **Incorrect symptom alleviation**: The INITIAL RESPONSE indicates pain alleviation upon sitting up, but the INPUT states pain is not alleviated by sitting up nor worsened lying down.\n3. **Assessment of pericarditis**: The INITIAL RESPONSE says pericarditis is unlikely due to age, but does not substantiate this with evidence from the INPUT nor consider considerations for this possibility.\n4. **Panic attack selection**: The decision for Panic Attack as the most likely diagnosis is made despite the INPUT clearly indicating no sudden shortness of breath or altered heart rate, which are often associated with Panic Attacks. \n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to correctly evaluate and incorporate significant information from the INPUT in its analysis, missing relevant connections to the correct diagnosis labeled as Pericarditis. Instead, the response dismisses or misrepresents several critical pieces of evidence from the INPUT without appropriate rationale.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
