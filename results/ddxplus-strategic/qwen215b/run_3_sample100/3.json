Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 45\\nSex: F\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - occiput\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Influenza\\n- URTI\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 45-year-old female not living with family or attending daycare.

    "prediction": "The evaluation of the INITIAL RESPONSE shows that the response does not demonstrate a high degree of decision acumen. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. The response incorrectly states that options such as Pneumonia, Bronchitis, Influenza, URTI, and Tuberculosis are \"not listed\" in the provided options, whereas all these are clearly listed in the 'options' section of the INPUT. This indicates a fundamental error in reading and understanding the provided data.\n\n2. The decision-making process is flawed, as the conclusion that \"the most likely diagnosis is Influenza\" is based on an inaccurate assessment of the options. Influenza is one of the options listed, yet it is dismissed as \"not listed.\"\n\n3. The response does not provide any reasoning pertinent to the user's symptoms (e.g., lack of fever, cough, or other flu-like symptoms characteristic of Influenza) that would support considering Influenza as the diagnosis, especially when comparing it to the correct label, URTI.\n\n4. The reasoning should instead have focused on URTI as an option since a headache and some upper respiratory symptoms could potentially align with URTI, and the lack of other symptoms like fever should have contributed to its eligibility.\n\nThese points illustrate a lack of careful deliberation and logical deduction based on the INPUT, leading to an incorrect conclusion regarding the options available and the diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and precision in its decision-making process.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
