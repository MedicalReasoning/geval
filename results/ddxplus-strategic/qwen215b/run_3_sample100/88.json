Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 21\\nSex: M\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- PSVT\\n- Anemia\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 21-year-old male with no known heart valve issues, COPD, shortness of breath, diabetes, significant overweight, slight dizziness, and no heart attack history.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not demonstrate strong decision acumen according to the criterion. The response lacks clarity and precision in its decision-making process. It fails to differentiate effectively between valid and invalid options based on the given evidences. Several options could be immediately ruled out with the already available evidence, but the response inadequately analyzes these options.\n\nFor example, Panic attack is suggested as the most likely diagnosis without supporting evidence from the symptoms. The conclusion made is imprecise considering that the travel-related comment (\"Unlikely without recent travel\") is incorrectly used for Panic attacks, which are typically related to stress or anxiety rather than travel. Furthermore, Atrial fibrillation is not addressed or evaluated correctly considering the symptoms provided. This lack of a careful and thorough review of options demonstrates a failure in decisive reasoning. Therefore, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not show a high-level confidence and logical deliberation.\n\nOverall, the response lacks logical coherence and precision in rejecting incorrect or irrelevant options decisively, thus demonstrating poor decision-making.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
