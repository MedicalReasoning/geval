Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 49\\nSex: M\\nHave you started or taken any antipsychotic medication within the last 7 days?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever felt like you were suffocating for a very short time associated with inability to breathe or speak?\\n    - N\\nHave you been treated in hospital recently for nausea, agitation, intoxication or aggressive behavior and received medication via an intravenous or intramuscular route?\\n    - N\\nDo you have trouble keeping your tongue in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hard time opening/raising one or both eyelids?\\n    - N\\nDo you have annoying muscle spasms in your face, neck or any other part of your body?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 49-year-old male without any symptoms or treatment history, indicating either no exposure to antipsychotic medications or a different diagnosis, consistent with a diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis.\n\n```Myasthenia gravis```\n\nLABEL:\nAcute dystonic reactions\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not demonstrate strong decision acumen based on the provided INPUT. The response indicates that a 49-year-old male without any symptoms or treatment history is consistent with a diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis. However, the INPUT questions specifically address the presence of symptoms and treatment history related to conditions that could be consistent with dystonic reactions. Given the evidence, the INITIAL RESPONSE overlooks the correct option in the LABEL, which is \"Acute dystonic reactions.\" The decision made in the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks thorough evaluation and fails to account for relevant information that could disprove its conclusion. There is no clear rejection of the diagnosis \"Acute dystonic reactions\" with reasoning from the INPUT. Therefore, the decision-making process demonstrated here is not precise or justified.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
