Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 1\\nSex: F\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you had a cold in the last 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that the tone of your voice has become deeper, softer or hoarse?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute laryngitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Acute otitis media\\n- Epiglottitis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n```Acute laryngitis```\n\nThe other options do not fit the clinical presentation:\n\n- Bronchitis: Persistent cough, fever, and difficulty breathing are typical.\n- Pneumonia: Cough, fever, chest pain, and difficulty breathing are common.\n- Tuberculosis: Continuous cough and weight loss are typical.\n- Viral pharyngitis: Pain, hoarseness, and fever are typical.\n- Acute otitis media: Ear pain, hearing loss, and fever are typical.\n- Chagas: Deafness, abdominal pain, and fever are typical.\n\nLABEL:\nAcute laryngitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provides a clear evaluation of the given symptoms and systematically eliminates each of the potential diagnoses that do not match the clinical presentation. The decision to diagnose \"Acute laryngitis\" is backed by thorough reasoning, explicitly rejecting other possibilities like \"Bronchitis,\" \"Pneumonia,\" and others by aligning common symptoms related to these conditions with the patient's described symptoms, such as the absence of cough, fever, or difficulty breathing. The response maintains a logical and deliberate approach in decision-making, confidently ruling out options that do not fit the evidence provided in the INPUT.\n\n```PREDICTION```Yes```"
