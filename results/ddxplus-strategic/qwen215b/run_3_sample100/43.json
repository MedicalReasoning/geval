Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 75\\nSex: M\\nAre you currently taking or have you recently taken anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)?\\n    - N\\nDo you take corticosteroids?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - sensitive\\n    - tugging\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - ankle(R)\\n    - ankle(L)\\n    - thigh(L)\\n    - sole(R)\\n    - sole(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHave you gained weight recently?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have liver cirrhosis?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had surgery to remove lymph nodes?\\n    - N\\nDo you take a calcium channel blockers (medication)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have swelling in one or more areas of your body?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - ankle(R)\\n    - ankle(L)\\n    - thigh(R)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(R)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(L)\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Localized edema\\n- Chagas\\n- Anaphylaxis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 75-year-old man with pain in his right and left ankle, thigh, and sole, feeling like a tugging sensation and a dull pain, with no swelling in recent days.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE makes several errors in decision-making. First, it inaccurately summarizes the INPUT data; for example, it incorrectly states that the patient experiences a \"tugging sensation and a dull pain\" along with \"pain in his right and left ankle, thigh, and sole,\" while the INPUT specifies different characteristics for the pain. Moreover, the initial response refers to a \"dull pain,\" which is not mentioned in the INPUT. The response also misrepresents the patient's medication history, claiming he \"takes calcium channel blockers,\" whereas the evidence indicates otherwise. Furthermore, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not effectively reject the incorrect options; it merely states that Chagas \"fails to describe the pain and origin\" without adequate reasoning and incorrectly asserts that anaphylaxis \"can mimic ankle pain\" without supporting evidence from the INPUT. Ultimately, the response fails to demonstrate strong decision-making skills and lacks a clear, deliberate approach, relying on inaccurate summaries and weak rejection of negatives.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
