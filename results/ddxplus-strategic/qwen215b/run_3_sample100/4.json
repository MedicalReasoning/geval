Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 54\\nSex: M\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - occiput\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 54-year-old male with no recent contact with infected persons, living alone, no pain related to his reason for consulting, no pain in top of head, cheek(R), cheek(L), or occiput. The pain is described as sensitive and causing discomfort, intensity 4/10, does not radiate, located 2/10, and appears slowly. He doesn't smoke, has no sore throat, no diffuse muscle pain, runs a clear runny nose, and hasn't traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- URTI: Could be a cold, but typically presents with symptoms of fever and cough.\n\n- Cluster headache: Usually presents with a \"wingspan\" pattern of pain and has a history of migraines.\n\n- Chagas: Common in Central and South America, can present with abdominal pain and vomiting.\n\n- Anemia: Common in elderly men, but not typically with these symptoms.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is URTI.\n\n```URTI```\n\nLABEL:\nURTI\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provided does not make precise decisions using the evidence from the INPUT. Here are the key points to consider:\n\n1. The response incorrectly summarizes the patient's symptoms, for example, stating \"no pain in top of head, cheek(R), cheek(L), or occiput,\" which is contrary to the listed symptoms in the INPUT.\n\n2. Failure to properly evaluate the symptoms against the listed options. The response does not effectively link the given symptoms to any of the options provided. For example, URTI is eliminated too casually on the basis of lacking symptoms like fever and cough, without noting any coalescence with patient's symptoms like nasal conditions, which might be related to URTI.\n\n3. No clear reason is provided for rejecting other options. The response does not clearly rule out conditions like cluster headache or anemia based on symptoms provided in the INPUT.\n\n4. The conclusion of URTI being the most probable diagnosis is not well-supported, given the incomplete and inaccurate analysis of symptoms.\n\nBecause of these inadequacies, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to meet the criterion of Decision Acumen, as it does not exhibit the necessary level of accuracy, detailed analysis, or a confident, clear rejection of incorrect options based on evidence.\n\nThus, the decision is not made effectively and accurately.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
