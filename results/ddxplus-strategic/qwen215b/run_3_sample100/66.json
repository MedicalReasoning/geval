Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 20\\nSex: M\\nHave any of your family members been diagnosed with cluster headaches?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - tugging\\n    - violent\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - eye(L)\\n    - temple(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you feel that your eyes produce excessive tears?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Cluster headache\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 20-year-old male with no family history of cluster headaches or pain related to his reason for consultation.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not adequately follow the decision acumen criterion due to several shortcomings:\n\n1. Incorrect Analysis: The response fails to accurately analyze the case. Despite the fact that the patient reports intense and localized pain with characteristics that could align with cluster headaches, the absence of key symptoms such as excessive tear production and nasal congestion, which are commonly associated with cluster headaches, should have been taken into account.\n\n2. Incomplete Deliberation: The response dismisses other options like Chagas and Anemia without thorough consideration. While it may be unlikely, the rationale for rejecting them is not sufficiently detailed, particularly for anemia, which should have been discussed further given the symptom of intense pain.\n\n3. Insufficient Justification: The decision to conclude \"Cluster headache\" is not thoroughly justified. A well-deliberated response should have included explicit reasons for both accepting and rejecting potential diagnoses based on the evidence.\n\n4. Lack of Logical Approach: The conclusion should be clearly linked to the evidence provided, yet this response lacks coherence in connecting the symptoms to the chosen diagnosis with confidence and logic.\n\nThe response doesn't decisively engage with the provided information or clearly justify the rejection of inappropriate options. Therefore, it signifies poor decision-making.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
