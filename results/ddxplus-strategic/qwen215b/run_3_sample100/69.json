Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 66\\nSex: F\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - occiput\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Influenza\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchitis\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Chagas\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 66-year-old woman with increased sweating, no pain associated, and subjective heavy pain on the top of the head, cheek(R), cheek(L), and occiput.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making abilities in several ways. First, it inaccurately summarizes the evidence by stating \"increased sweating\" when the evidence indicates that there is no significantly increased sweating. Furthermore, the response reaches a conclusion (URTI) that doesn't align with the symptoms provided because URTI commonly includes symptoms such as a runny nose, cough, and possibly a sore throat, none of which are present in the evidence. Lastly, the response fails to decisively reject incorrect or irrelevant diagnoses like acute rhinosinusitis or chronic rhinosinusitis by not leveraging the evidence related to pain severity and its characteristics accurately. These missed and inaccurate assessments lead to an imprecise conclusion demonstrating weak decision acumen.\n\nThe initial response did not confidently reject incorrect options nor support its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
