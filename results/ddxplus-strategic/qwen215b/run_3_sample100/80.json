Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 2\\nSex: M\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you had chills or shivers?\\n    - N\\nDo you have Parkinson’s disease?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had pneumonia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any lesions, redness or problems on your skin that you believe are related to the condition you are consulting for?\\n    - N\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - pink\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - Y\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - side of the neck(L)\\n    - buttock(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - shoulder(R)\\n    - shoulder(L)\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - N\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had a loss of appetite or do you get full more quickly then usually?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nIs your BMI less than 18.5, or are you underweight?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pneumonia\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Influenza\\n- GERD\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Sarcoidosis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 2-year-old unvaccinated child with no cough, no pain, no fever, no shivers, and no alcohol use.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions and weak distinctions between valid and invalid options. It makes several errors and misjudgments. For instance, the response incorrectly states \"No rashes,\" whereas the INPUT mentions a rash characterized by peeling and located on the side of the neck, buttocks, shoulder, and posterior chest wall. Misinterpreting this evidence shows a lack of attention to detail which is crucial for accurate decision-making. It also incorrectly describes several options without sufficient grounding in the available evidence. For example, it describes \"Bronchitis\" as the most probable diagnosis, despite the absence of key symptoms like cough or fever mentioned in the INPUT. The INITIAL RESPONSE fails to confidently reject irrelevant options and make a precise distinction based on a thorough evaluation of the INPUT, resulting in an incorrect prediction of Bronchitis rather than Pneumonia. \n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
