Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 26\\nSex: M\\nIs your nose or the back of your throat itchy?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe itching in one or both eyes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live in in a big city?\\n    - N\\nAre you more likely to develop common allergies than the general population?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Allergic sinusitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Influenza'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe given information suggests a patient with no symptoms of common allergies, traveling less than 4 weeks, and living in a non-big city. This indicates a less likely case of Influenza (the common cold).\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAllergic sinusitis: Common in people with allergies and travel history.\n\nBronchitis: Common in smokers.\n\nURTI: Often includes cough, fever, and facial flushing, but not all.\n\nInfluenza: A common cold.\n\nBased on the given information, the most likely diagnosis is Bronchitis.\n\n```Bronchitis```\n\nLABEL:\nAllergic sinusitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not demonstrate strong decision-making skills based on the INPUT. The reasoning does not thoroughly evaluate the options provided against the given evidence. The response inaccurately associates Influenza with the common cold, and there is a misleading analysis claiming Bronchitis as a conclusion despite no supporting symptoms from the evidence indicating any potential respiratory issues like coughing, which is crucial for such a diagnosis. Furthermore, Allergic sinusitis and its connection to travel is incorrectly assumed without any given evidence of travel. \n\nThere is a lack of clear justification for rejecting other diagnoses, causing it to fail to reject hard negatives effectively. Overall, the response lacks a detailed comparison and fails to exhibit thoughtful and decisive evaluation, leading to an incorrect conclusion.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
