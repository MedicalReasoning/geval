Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 61\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - upper chest\\n    - pharynx\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- GERD\\n- Influenza\\n- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe patient is 61 years old and reports pain on the side of the chest, upper chest, and pharynx.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clear decision-making acumen. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. The INITIAL RESPONSE does not adequately justify why bronchitis is the most probable diagnosis given that the input clearly indicates \"no cough,\" which is a primary symptom of bronchitis. This represents a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant options.\n\n2. The response lists several conditions as \"initial diagnosis\" based on insufficient evaluation. For instance, it introduces several unrelated or contradictory conditions (e.g., URTI, GERD, Influenza, Bronchospasm/acute asthma exacerbation, etc.) without adequately ruling them out. This results in a confusing array of tentative diagnoses rather than a concise, precise conclusion.\n\n3. There is a noticeable lack of clarity and structured decision-making as the response fails to analyze the available evidence comprehensively. For example, many conditions mentioned depend on symptoms that were negated in the INPUT, like fever or cough.\n\nOverall, the decision-making process demonstrated in the INITIAL RESPONSE does not exhibit a high level of confidence or precision. It fails to make clear distinctions and rejections where necessary, and therefore, does not meet the criterion of strong decision acumen.\n\nPREDICTION: ```PREDICTION```No```"
