Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 4\\nSex: M\\nDo you have a poor diet?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a diagnosis of anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - tugging\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - back of head\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - temple(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel so tired that you are unable to do your usual activities or are you stuck in your bed all day long?\\n    - N\\nDo you constantly feel fatigued or do you have non-restful sleep?\\n    - N\\nDo you have chronic kidney failure?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had stools that were black (like coal)?\\n    - N\\nAre you taking any new oral anticoagulants ((NOACs)?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed light red blood or blood clots in your stool?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nIs your BMI less than 18.5, or are you underweight?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Anemia\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Myocarditis\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA newborn with a poor diet, anemia, and no signs of pain.

    "prediction": "The initial response appears to lack clarity and precision in its decision-making. It inaccurately describes the patient as a newborn with a poor diet and anemia, which contradicts the given input data. There is no indication of poor diet or anemia in the input. Furthermore, the response mentions that Myocarditis is present in adults, which is not a strong argument given the patient's age. The decision to conclude Anemia seems unsupported by the input evidence, as it fails to address or justify this choice with the given information. Rather than grounding its decision in the actual evidence provided, the response seems to be based on incorrect assumptions and misinterpretations of the input information.\n\nTherefore, the response does not demonstrate good decision acumen, as it draws imprecise conclusions and fails to reject irrelevant options based on the input data.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
