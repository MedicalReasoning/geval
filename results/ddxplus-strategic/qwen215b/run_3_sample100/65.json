Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 10\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - tugging\\n    - burning\\n    - sickening\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - hypochondrium(L)\\n    - belly\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - lower chest\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hiatal hernia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you think you are pregnant or are you currently pregnant?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently thrown up blood or something resembling coffee beans?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that get worse after eating?\\n    - N', 'options': '- GERD'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 10-year-old female with a sensitive, a knife stroke, and a burning sensation that starts in the stomach and goes up into the throat.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision acumen for several reasons:\n\n1. The response inaccurately describes the symptoms. The INPUT states the patient does not have a burning sensation that starts in the stomach and goes up into the throat, yet the response incorrectly includes this as a symptom.\n\n2. It doesn't clearly distinguish between possibilities. Despite the consistent mention of GERD as \"not typical for this age,\" it ultimately concludes \"Burning sensation (GERD)\" is the most likely diagnosis without clear justification, especially since the input does not align with GERD symptoms.\n\n3. The response includes irrelevant and incorrect analysis regarding asthma and hiatal hernia, which weren't specified options in the INPUT.\n\n4. The INITIAL RESPONSE fails to decisively reject other incorrect or irrelevant options, muddling the final conclusion.\n\nGiven these points, the response lacks clarity and thoughtful deliberation, failing to make precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
