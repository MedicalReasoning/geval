Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 41\\nSex: M\\nDo you have a poor diet?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a diagnosis of anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have any family members who have been diagnosed with anemia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tugging\\n    - a cramp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - temple(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel lightheaded and dizzy or do you feel like you are about to faint?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had stools that were black (like coal)?\\n    - N\\nAre you taking any new oral anticoagulants ((NOACs)?\\n    - N\\nIs your skin much paler than usual?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed light red blood or blood clots in your stool?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Anemia\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Panic attack\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- PSVT\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Cluster headache'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 41-year-old male with a poor diet and no family history of anemia.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE fails to exhibit strong decision acumen because it makes a significant error in identifying the most probable diagnosis as Anemia, despite clear evidence suggesting otherwise. The INPUT explicitly provides evidence that the individual does not have a poor diet, has no family history of anemia, and lacks any symptoms or diagnosis of anemia. Additionally, the INITIAL RESPONSE acknowledges these negative indications for anemia. Furthermore, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not properly consider or eliminate other diagnostic options in light of the available evidence. For instance, the presence of temple pain suggests a condition like a cluster headache is more consistent with the symptoms. This overlooks the key details that would lead to a more accurate differential diagnosis. Therefore, rather than decisively ruling out Anemia based on the given negative evidence and considering other possible conditions, the INITIAL RESPONSE incorrectly concludes with Anemia, demonstrating a lack of precise decision-making.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
