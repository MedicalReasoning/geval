Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 49\\nSex: F\\nDo you have an active cancer?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - scapula(R)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you currently take hormones?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - nowhere\\nDid you lose consciousness?\\n    - N\\nHave you had surgery within the last month?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America', 'options': '- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Panic attack\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Ebola\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 49-year-old female with symptoms of coughing up blood, pain on the side of the chest, sensitivity to pain, and shortness of breath.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not demonstrate strong decision acumen for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Inaccurate Recap**: The recap of symptoms is not fully accurate. The patient specifically denies coughing up blood, shortness of breath, and hormone usage, among other things. The response inaccurately lists coughing up blood and shortness of breath as symptoms.\n\n2. **Incorrect Conclusion**: Despite the evidence pointing more towards a pulmonary embolism due to the sharp pain symptom without coughing up blood or shortness of breath, the INITIAL RESPONSE concludes with acute pulmonary edema, which typically involves difficulty breathing, a symptom the patient denies.\n\n3. **Lack of Justification**: The response mentions conditions as \"not typical\" without providing a justification based on the symptoms provided in the INPUT.\n\n4. **Failure to Reject Hard Negatives**: Important negatives such as the absence of shortness of breath, leg swelling, and recent surgery are not appropriately factored into the decision-making process. This limits the response’s ability to confidently reject certain options like acute pulmonary edema.\n\n5. **Inconsistent with LABEL**: The final prediction does not align with the provided LABEL \"Pulmonary embolism,\" illustrating a lack of coherence and clarity in decision-making.\n\nBecause of these issues, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not clearly demonstrate careful deliberation, precise distinctions, or a confident rejection of negative options. \n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
