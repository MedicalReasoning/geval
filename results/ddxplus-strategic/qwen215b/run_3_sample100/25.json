Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 50\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\n    - sickening\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - hypochondrium(R)\\n    - hypochondrium(L)\\n    - belly\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - upper chest\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hiatal hernia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had stools that were black (like coal)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that get worse after eating?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N', 'options': '- GERD\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Anemia\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 50-year-old male with a burning sensation that starts in his stomach and goes up into his throat, with a bitter taste in the mouth.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE provided does not accurately utilize the given evidence to make a precise and concise decision. It starts with an incorrect statement: \"A 50-year-old male with a burning sensation that starts in his stomach and goes up into his throat, with a bitter taste in the mouth,\" which is not supported by the INPUT evidence. The INPUT explicitly states \"Do you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\" with a response of 'N', indicating that this symptom is not present. This misinterpretation leads the response to incorrectly assess GERD and mistakenly conclude Pericarditis as the diagnosis without considering relevant evidence or symptoms. Additionally, the initial response failed to provide clear justification for rejecting relevant possibilities like GERD, which aligns more closely with the burning character of the pain reported, despite not having the typical associated symptoms. There was insufficient deliberation of the data and inappropriate rejection of options. Overall, the decision-making was flawed, lacking clarity and precision, resulting in the incorrect conclusion. \n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
