Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 6\\nSex: F\\nDo you have an active cancer?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nHave you been unable to move or get up for more than 3 consecutive days within the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have swelling in one or more areas of your body?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - posterior aspect of the ankle(L)\\n    - calf(L)\\nHave you had surgery within the last month?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 6-year-old female with coughing up blood and pain in the side of the chest, associated with a sharp sensation.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates a lack of decision acumen for several reasons:\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of Evidences:** The response inaccurately states that the patient is \"coughing up blood,\" whereas the INPUT states that the patient is not. This misinterpretation leads to flawed analyses and conclusions.\n\n2. **Inappropriate Conclusions:** The conclusion that pulmonary embolism is the most likely diagnosis does not align with the INPUT. Pulmonary embolism typically presents with shortness of breath and other symptoms which the patient does not have according to the INPUT.\n\n3. **Failure to Reject Hard Negatives:** There is no evidence in the INPUT supporting the presence of a pulmonary embolism. Important symptoms like shortness of breath and coughing up blood are absent, yet the response fails to use this information to rule out pulmonary embolism.\n\n4. **Illogical Analysis:** Misinterpretation and incorrect rationale are evident in the analysis, lacking thoroughness and logic based on the provided evidence.\n\nThe response fails to effectively evaluate the documented evidences and doesn't confidently reject the hard negatives, leading to the incorrect conclusion.
