Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 56\\nSex: F\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Larygospasm'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 56-year-old woman who has a high-pitched sound when breathing in and has not traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE shows poor decision-making since it misrepresents the INPUT details from the outset and continues with deductions that contradict the given evidences. The symptoms described include a high-pitched sound when breathing in, which the INPUT specifically states does not exist. Yet, the response lists multiple conditions associated with such a symptom. It incorrectly interprets the travel history and exposure to secondhand smoke, misleadingly concluding that they have a high-pitched sound when they do not. Consequently, the response's conclusion lacks clarity, permanence in supporting reasoning, and fails to recognize Larygospasm doesn't fit the provided options due to evidence misreading. There are inappropriate distinctions and illogical deductions that result in an imprecise decision based on a false assumption.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
