Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 26\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Influenza\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Chagas\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 26-year-old female with no history of fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose, or cough.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits some faulty decision-making. It has a glaring error in the initial step, incorrectly stating that the patient attended a daycare when the input specifies that they did not. This alone indicates poor attention to the details provided. Moreover, the response allocates unnecessary likelihood to initial HIV infection and tuberculosis, which the input doesn't support due to a lack of relevant symptoms.\n\nThe response mentions options without adequately distinguishing between them with concrete evidence from the INPUT. The conclusion is vague, presenting two possible conditions without a decisive rationale given the evidence. It fails to confidently reject irrelevant options such as \"HIV (initial infection),\" which is not associated with the symptoms and fails to address each option with corresponding reasoning from the inputs.\n\nOverall, this response lacks precision and doesn't appropriately leverage the evidence to make clear distinctions or decisive conclusions.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
