Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 31\\nSex: F\\nHave you been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known heart defect?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating very irregularly or in a disorganized pattern?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America', 'options': '- Atrial fibrillation\\n- PSVT\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 31-year-old female who feels dizzy, lightheaded, and is not in the middle of any acute cardiac events, having never been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism or heart disease.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Occurs with rapid, irregular heartbeat.\n\nPSVT: Paramyocardial supraventricular tachycardia.\n\nAnemia: Low red blood cells.\n\nScombroid food poisoning: Common after eating raw or undercooked seafood.\n\nAn anemia would cause fatigue, not lightheadedness, but this does not match her symptoms.\n\nHypothyroidism is not a common cause of lightheadedness.\n\nHypertension is not a cause of lightheadedness.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is a normal clinical presentation with no other major concerns.\n\n```Normal clinical presentation```\n\nLABEL:\nAtrial fibrillation\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not meet the criterion of strong decision acumen. The response begins by incorrectly stating that the individual feels dizzy and lightheaded, which contradicts the INPUT where the individual reports not feeling these symptoms. The response provides generic descriptions of the options but fails to adequately evaluate them based on the evidences given. Additionally, the decision to conclude a \"normal clinical presentation\" reflects a misunderstanding of the task, as the correct label was \"Atrial fibrillation,\" and there is no clear reasoning provided for why the specific label was not chosen. The response also includes several unrelated points such as hypothetical conditions ('hypothyroidism,' 'hypertension') that do not stem from the provided evidences. Overall, the response lacks coherence, precision, and the ability to reject irrelevant options confidently.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
