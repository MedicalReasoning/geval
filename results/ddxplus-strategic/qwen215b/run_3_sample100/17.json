Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 59\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - occiput\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 59-year-old female with no history of cough, fever, or sore throat, no travel, no exposure to secondhand smoke, no contact with similar symptoms, and no sore throat or cough.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nBronchitis: Often associated with a cough, but here there is no cough.\n\nURTI: Usually non-specific symptoms, doesn't look like URTI.\n\nCluster headache: Not usually associated with other symptoms here.\n\nChagas: No previous history.\n\nAnemia: No history of anemia.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is URTI.\n\n```URTI```\n\nLABEL:\nURTI\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "To evaluate the INITIAL RESPONSE for Decision Acumen, I will analyze the decision-making process and the correctness of the conclusions the response arrived at.\n\n1. **Understanding of Symptoms and Background**: The response accurately synthesized the information given about the patient (59-year-old female, no cough, sore throat, contact history, etc.).\n\n2. **Evaluation of Options**: \n   - The response correctly rules out *Bronchitis* due to absence of cough, which is a key symptom of bronchitis.\n   - Dismisses *Cluster Headache* considering it's \"not usually associated with other symptoms here,\" but doesn't clearly align any particular symptoms with it.\n   - Correctly notes \"no previous history\" for *Chagas*, though this isn't much of a logical analysis involving existing symptoms compared to typical Chagas disease indicators.\n   - Incorrectly uses \"No history of anemia\" as a reason for dismissal without referring to symptoms, as anemia would be diagnosed with different signs than presented.\n   - Claims URTI \"doesn't look like URTI,\" but then contradictorily concludes it as the most likely diagnosis without thoroughly justifying it relative to other more distinct options for headaches/bodily pain like *Cluster Headache*.\n\n3. **Decision Clarity**:\n   - The final decision lacks a highly logical underlying reason opposing directly alternative choices (e.g., cluster headache considering presented localized pain and intensity).\n   - Weak conflicting conclusions i.e., first implying URTI isn't fitting, then selecting it as the most likely incorrect and without strong justification besides process of elimination.\n\n4. **Rejection of Irrelevant Data**:\n   - Does not integrate irrelevant symptoms into focused troubleshooting (second-hand smoke exposure, sore throat unlinked observations weren't improperly conflated).\n\nOverall, the response navigates through the options inconsistently. It eliminated options without showing in-depth deliberation on actually relevant symptoms per likely conditions. Thus, the response misses coherence in explaining and supporting its conclusion impartially and confidently.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
