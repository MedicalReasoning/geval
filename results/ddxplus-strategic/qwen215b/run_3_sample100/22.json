Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 4\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Croup\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 4-year-old girl with pain on the side of the chest, characterized as burning.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE goes through the symptoms one by one and appropriately connects the symptoms to the potential diagnoses given in the INPUT. The deliberation disqualifies each possibility by aligning each symptom with each diagnosis, which demonstrates a thorough evaluation of the given information and alternatives. However, it reaches an incorrect conclusion.\n\nIt concludes that the most likely diagnosis is Pneumonia, yet the labeled diagnosis is Bronchitis. The conclusion of Pneumonia is not strongly supported due to the evidence provided, which indicates the absence of fever, shortness of breath, or cough, making it less likely than Bronchitis. Additionally, some incorrect assumptions (e.g., Atrial fibrillation not uncommon in children) might have adversely affected decision precision. Despite presenting elimination for each option, the response ultimately arrives at a conclusion not consistent with the labeled outcome.\n\nHence, the decision-making process lacks the necessary precision and does not make a confident and correct rejection of alternates to select the labeled answer accurately.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
