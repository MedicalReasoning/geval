Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 48\\nSex: F\\nDo you have Rheumatoid Arthritis?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you suffer from Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis (UC)?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had pneumonia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you immunosuppressed?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 48-year-old female presenting with symptoms of coughing up blood (negative for pneumonia, COPD, or other lung diseases), shortness of breath (negative for bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and bronchospasm/cough exacerbation), and anemia (negative for myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders).\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nBronchitis: May present with blood in sputum but usually due to inflammation.\n\nBronchiectasis: Involves atelectasis and hypoxemia.\n\nPneumonia: May cause cough and shortness of breath.\n\nPulmonary neoplasm: Can be diagnosed through imaging.\n\nAcute COPD exacerbation/infection: May present with shortness of breath.\n\nTuberculosis: Common in the upper respiratory tract.\n\nPulmonary embolism: Usually caused by a blood clot.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome: Rare.\n\nBronchospasm/acute asthma exacerbation: May be seen in asthmatics.\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Heart rhythm disorder.\n\nMyocarditis: Cardiac inflammation.\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Neurological.\n\nMyasthenia gravis: Muscle weakness.\n\nAnemia: Red blood cell problems.\n\nPSVT: Potential indication of a cardiac issue.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is **Tuberculosis**.\n\n```Tuberculosis```\n\nLABEL:\nBronchiectasis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE undertakes a clear step-by-step analysis of the patient profile and the provided options. However, it seems to misinterpret or overlook some of the evidence from the input, such as the absence of coughing up blood and other significant symptoms like shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, which are negative in the given input. It also erroneously concludes \"Tuberculosis\" without acknowledging the input evidence negating such conditions. The decision reflects a lack of alignment with the available data in the input, failing to make precise distinctions based on the information. This inconsistency implies weak decision acumen, as it does not thoroughly exclude or clearly justify the decision against other possible conditions or correctly interpret the input symptoms to validate the conclusion confidently.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
