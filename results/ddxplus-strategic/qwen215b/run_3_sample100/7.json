Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 55\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - palace\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 55-year-old female with no history of similar symptoms in the last 2 weeks, living alone, attending a daycare, mild pain in her tonsils (tonsil(R) or tonsil(L)), and a burning pain localized to her jaw.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not demonstrate strong decision acumen based on the given INPUT. The response inaccurately summarizes some of the crucial details from the INPUT and makes several errors in reasoning:\n\n1. It incorrectly claims the individual is attending daycare, while the input clearly states \"Do you attend or work in a daycare? - N.\" Additionally, it states that the individual is living alone based on the question \"Do you live with 4 or more people? - N,\" which only indicates they live with fewer than four people, not necessarily alone.\n\n2. The INITIAL RESPONSE also misinterprets URTI as \"urinary tract infection,\" which is incorrect. URTI stands for upper respiratory tract infection.\n\n3. The analysis lists several irrelevant conditions without adequately rejecting them. For example, it briefly mentions \"NSTEMI / STEMI: Less likely,\" and \"Unstable angina: More likely,\" without providing clear reasoning for these distinctions or explaining why more likely options such as viral pharyngitis are ignored.\n\n4. It mistakenly concludes with \"Stable angina\" as the diagnosis, despite the label indicating Viral pharyngitis.\n\nOverall, the response lacks clarity, precision, and grounded decision-making necessary to meet the criterion of Decision Acumen. There's also a failure to correctly evaluate and reject unlikely diagnoses thoughtfully, while confidently supporting the correct conclusion provided in the label.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
