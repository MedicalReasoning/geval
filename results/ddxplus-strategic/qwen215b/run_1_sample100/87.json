Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 77\\nSex: M\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - sensitive\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - temple(R)\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Influenza\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- HIV (initial infection)\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 77-year-old male who does not live with four or more people. He describes his pain as tedious and feels it in his temple, with the pain localized to the top of his head, 2 on a 1-10 scale. The pain does not radiate. He does not have a fever or a sore throat. He does not have nasal congestion or a runny nose. He did not travel out of the country in the last four weeks and is not exposed to secondhand smoke. His chest pain is not related to lung or respiratory diseases.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- URTI: Common, but not tedious and localized to one area.\n- Bronchitis: Common, but not tedious.\n- Influenza: Common, but not tedious, localized to the top of the head.\n- Tuberculosis: Not common.\n- HIV (initial infection): Not common.\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis: Not common.\n- Chagas: Not common.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is URTI, as it is common and not related to the other options.\n\n```URTI```\n\nLABEL:\nURTI\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making according to the criterion. The evaluation of the patient data is not thorough, and the conclusions drawn are imprecise and lack justification. Although the patient has some headache symptoms, the INITIAL RESPONSE fails to consider all signs and does not provide strong reasoning for labeling the condition as URTI. The response mistakenly ignores the nature of the pain and location, which does not fit the common presentation of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Additionally, the rejection of other options is unsubstantiated. Therefore, the decision-making process is flawed, lacking clarity and thoughtful deliberation.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
