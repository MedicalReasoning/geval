Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 26\\nSex: F\\nDo you feel your abdomen is bloated or distended (swollen due to pressure from inside)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - iliac fossa(R)\\n    - iliac fossa(L)\\n    - hip(R)\\n    - hip(L)\\n    - testicle(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhat color is the rash?\\n    - NA\\nDo your lesions peel off?\\n    - N\\nIs the rash swollen?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nWhere is the affected region located?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow intense is the pain caused by the rash?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nIs the lesion (or are the lesions) larger than 1cm?\\n    - N\\nHow severe is the itching?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have intense coughing fits?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Inguinal hernia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 26-year-old female with abdominal bloating and pain in the iliac fossa without any other symptoms.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE analyzes the available information and the given options to make a decision. However, there seems to be an oversight or mismatch in accurately representing the INPUT data in the INITIAL RESPONSE. Here are the key issues with the response:\n\n1. **Imprecise Conclusion**: The INITIAL RESPONSE concludes with \"Inguinal hernia\" as the most likely diagnosis but does not provide clear and logical justification based on the given INPUT. It states \"less likely\" for both options rather than clearly distinguishing between them based on evidence.\n\n2. **Misinterpretation of Evidence**: The INITIAL RESPONSE mentions \"abdominal bloating\" and \"pain in the iliac fossa,\" whereas the INPUT states \"Do you feel your abdomen is bloated?\" was answered with \"N\" (No), and \"Do you have pain somewhere?\" was answered with \"N\" (No). This is a misinterpretation of the evidence, leading to inaccurate decision-making.\n\n3. **Lack of Rejection of Hard Negatives**: The RESPONSE fails to decisively reject one of the given options as a \"hard negative\" with adequate reasoning. A response with strong decision acumen should clarify why one option is unequivocally less suitable based on evidence.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks precision and does not fulfill the criteria for strong decision-making. Therefore, it demonstrates inadequate decision acumen.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
