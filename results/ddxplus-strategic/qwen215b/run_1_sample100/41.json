Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 26\\nSex: M\\nIs your nose or the back of your throat itchy?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe itching in one or both eyes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live in in a big city?\\n    - N\\nAre you more likely to develop common allergies than the general population?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Allergic sinusitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Influenza'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe given information suggests a patient with no symptoms of common allergies, traveling less than 4 weeks, and living in a non-big city.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE should effectively make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation. However, in this case, the response lacks clarity and precision for several reasons:\n\n1. **Failure to Address Symptoms:**\n   - The INPUT clearly indicates that the patient shows no symptoms associated with common allergies or respiratory-related symptoms (e.g., itchy nose/throat, severe eye itching, nasal congestion, cough). Despite this, the response overlooks this important detail when determining the diagnosis of Bronchitis, typically associated with respiratory symptoms—chiefly a cough.\n\n2. **Misinterpretation of Influenza:**\n   - The response states that \"Influenza: A common cold,\" which is factually incorrect. Influenza is caused by a virus that generally leads to more severe symptoms than the common cold, including body aches, fever, chills, and fatigue. This misstatement reflects poorly on the decision-making process.\n\n3. **Incorrect Conclusion:**\n   - The response concludes with Bronchitis as the most likely diagnosis without any supporting evidence from the provided INPUT—given the absence of a cough or smoking history. The decision should directly correlate with any remaining viable option, but instead dismisses options without proper justification.\n\nOverall, the response fails in thorough evaluation and precision, jumping to an incorrect conclusion without using the provided symptom data effectively.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
