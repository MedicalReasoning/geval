Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 59\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - heavy\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - top of the head\\n    - forehead\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - cheek(L)\\n    - occiput\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- URTI\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 59-year-old female with no history of cough, fever, or sore throat, no travel, no exposure to secondhand smoke, no contact with similar symptoms, and no sore throat or cough.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nBronchitis: Often associated with a cough, but here there is no cough.\n\nURTI: Usually non-specific symptoms, doesn't look like URTI.\n\nCluster headache: Not usually associated with other symptoms here.\n\nChagas: No previous history.\n\nAnemia: No history of anemia.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is URTI.\n\n```URTI```\n\nLABEL:\nURTI\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making based on the provided INPUT. Here is the analysis:\n\n1. **Bronchitis**: The response correctly identifies that bronchitis is often associated with a cough, which the patient does not have. This option is appropriately rejected.\n\n2. **URTI (Upper Respiratory Tract Infection)**: The response concludes that the most likely diagnosis is URTI, yet URTI typically involves symptoms such as a cough or sore throat, which the patient explicitly does not have. The decision to choose URTI is not well supported by the INPUT and is a weak conclusion without clear reasoning.\n\n3. **Cluster headache**: The response states that cluster headaches are not associated with other symptoms mentioned, but it doesn't explicitly reject this as an option or consider that the patient has mentioned significant head pain. The explanation lacks sufficient consideration of the INPUT details regarding headache symptoms.\n\n4. **Chagas**: The response summarily dismisses Chagas citing no previous history, but it doesn't address its relevance to the current symptoms directly nor presents grounded evidence from the patient's symptoms to reject this as a possibility.\n\n5. **Anemia**: Says no history of anemia, which is appropriate, but doesn't weigh in the pain symptoms or other evidence provided in the INPUT in the broader context of anemia.\n\nThe response lacks careful deliberation and precision in evaluating the symptoms against the possible conditions listed in the OPTIONS. It does not adequately weigh the strong presence of headache symptoms nor justify the choice of URTI convincingly in light of the evidence. Given the lack of effective decision-making and evident weak conclusion, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not meet the criterion of Decision Acumen.\n\nPREDICTION: ```PREDICTION```No```"
