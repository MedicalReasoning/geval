Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 35\\nSex: F\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you had a cold in the last 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that the tone of your voice has become deeper, softer or hoarse?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute laryngitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Epiglottitis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe patient reports throat pain, tonsillar pain, and difficulty swallowing. The pain is described as sensitive and burning. The patient does not smoke, feel fever, cough, or have traveled during the last few weeks.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAcute laryngitis: Can cause throat pain.\n\nBronchitis: Can present with cough and sore throat.\n\nTuberculosis: Can induce fever and cough. However, the patient does not have fever, cough, or throat pain.\n\nEpiglottitis: Not usually associated with throat pain or pharyngeal symptoms.\n\nViral pharyngitis: Can cause throat pain and other common symptoms. However, the patient does not have fever.\n\nPossible NSTEMI / STEMI: Refers to myocardial ischemia, which can mimic throat pain but is more severe and would require immediate medical attention.\n\nUnstable angina: Can lead to chest pain but usually does not meet the patient's criteria.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis based on the symptoms provided is: Acute laryngitis.\n\n```Acute laryngitis```\n\nLABEL:\nAcute laryngitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The Initial Response lacks precision in several aspects. Firstly, it incorrectly states \"difficulty swallowing\" which is not mentioned in the INPUT. It also claims that Tuberculosis \"does not have throat pain,\" which seems inconsistent since the INPUT mentions pain in areas like the tonsils, pharynx, and under the jaw. Additionally, the response inaccurately asserts that Epiglottitis is not associated with throat pain or pharyngeal symptoms, which is contrary to medical expectations. Therefore, the response fails to demonstrate a careful deliberation and precise decision-making as required by the criterion.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
