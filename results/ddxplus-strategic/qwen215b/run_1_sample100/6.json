Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 7\\nSex: F\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have trouble keeping your tongue in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hard time opening/raising one or both eyelids?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel that muscle spasms or soreness in your neck are keeping you from turning your head to one side?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you suddenly have difficulty or an inability to open your mouth or have jaw pain when opening it?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Anemia\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe patient is a 7-year-old female with symptoms including shortness of breath, difficulty keeping the tongue in the mouth, difficulty opening the eyelids, soreness in the neck, and jaw pain.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAcute dystonic reactions: Symptoms match.\n\nPulmonary embolism: Less likely in a pediatric.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome: Typically seen in adults.\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Not typical in a child.\n\nMyocarditis: Not typical without clinical signs.\n\nAnemia: Not typical without treatment.\n\nAnaphylaxis: Not typical without specific symptoms.\n\nMyasthenia gravis: Not typical without symptoms.\n\nScombroid food poisoning: Not typical.\n\nPSVT: Not typical.\n\nSLE: Not typical.\n\nChagas: Not typical.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is Acute dystonic reactions.\n\n```Acute dystonic reactions```\n\nLABEL:\nAcute dystonic reactions\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE makes numerous incorrect assumptions and includes details that are not present in the INPUT. In the INPUT, the user denies experiencing symptoms such as shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, difficulty keeping the tongue in the mouth, difficulty opening eyelids, soreness in the neck affecting head movement, or jaw pain. The response inaccurately lists these symptoms as if they were present, skewing the analysis.\n\nThe decision to choose \"Acute dystonic reactions\" as the diagnosis does not align with the evidence provided, since none of the accompanying symptoms that would support this conclusion (like those related to movement or muscle issues) are confirmed in the INPUT. Additionally, the rejection of other options lacks specific reasoning tied to the evidence. Overall, this shows a lack of precision and clear, supported decision-making.\n\nTherefore, the response does not demonstrate strong decision acumen as per the criterion set, as it fails in making concise and distinct evaluations based on the provided evidence.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
