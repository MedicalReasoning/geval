Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 49\\nSex: F\\nDo you have an active cancer?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - scapula(R)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you currently take hormones?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - nowhere\\nDid you lose consciousness?\\n    - N\\nHave you had surgery within the last month?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America', 'options': '- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Panic attack\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Ebola\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 49-year-old female with symptoms of coughing up blood, pain on the side of the chest, sensitivity to pain, and shortness of breath.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making for several reasons:\n\n1. Factually Incorrect Details: The Initial Response inaccurately summarizes the input data. The INPUT clearly states that the patient does not have an active cancer, has not been coughing up blood, and does not experience shortness of breath, yet the response describes the patient as having symptoms that include coughing up blood and shortness of breath. This indicates lack of attention to the critical details that are crucial for arriving at an accurate diagnosis.\n\n2. Imprecise and Weak Deliberation: The response fails to provide clear reasoning for rejecting most of the options. It dismisses multiple medical conditions as \"not typical\" without a thorough evaluation or adequate explanation based on the INPUT provided. Terms like \"not typical\" are vague and do not demonstrate effective decision-making without additional context or reasoning.\n\n3. Incorrect Conclusion: Despite the high importance of getting the diagnosis right, the INITIAL RESPONSE concludes with \"Acute pulmonary edema,\" while the correct label is \"Pulmonary embolism.\" This shows a lack of alignment with the available evidence which suggests that, based on the symptoms and context provided, a pulmonary embolism is a more plausible diagnosis.\n\nThese points indicate that the INITIAL RESPONSE does not effectively make precise distinctions between the options nor does it decisively reject incorrect diagnoses appropriately.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
