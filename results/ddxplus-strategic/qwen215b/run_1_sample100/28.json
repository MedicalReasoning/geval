Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 10\\nSex: F\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you immunosuppressed?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Influenza\\n- Pneumonia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 10-year-old girl with sore throat, cough, tonsil pain, and no fever.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE begins by restating some of the key details from the input, identifying the patient as a 10-year-old girl with tonsil pain and no fever, and dismisses several significant data points like the absence of a cough, fever, and recent travel. It analyzes the options and correctly identifies symptoms associated with each, but inaccurisely asserts that the patient has a cough, which she does not. Moreover, it fails to mention factors like the rapid pain onset or the character of pain, which are relevant for differential diagnosis. Finally, it concludes with Viral pharyngitis based on incorrect assumptions about the presence of a cough and lack of decisive rejection of other possibilities grounded in the input evidence, showing a lack of focused decision-making.\n\nGiven that the decision-making process contains notable errors and doesn't fully consider or accurately represent the input evidence, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not decisively meet the \"Decision Acumen\" criterion. There isn't enough deliberate and precise distinction among the given options, nor strong data-driven rejection of hard negatives.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
