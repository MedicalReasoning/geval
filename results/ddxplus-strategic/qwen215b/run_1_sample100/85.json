Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 20\\nSex: M\\nHave you ever had a spontaneous pneumothorax?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - heartbreaking\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - violent\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\n    - breast(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nHave any of your family members ever had a pneumothorax?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Pericarditis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe patient is 20 years old with no history of spontaneous pneumothorax, no pain when breathing, no family history of pneumothorax, no travel in the last 4 weeks.

The response claims \"He is a smoker and has a history of COPD,\" which contradicts the evidences that state \"Do you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? - N.\" It also fails to reject the other potential options with justification based on the given information, such as the absence of pain when breathing and the lack of factors indicating \"Spontaneous pneumothorax.\" The decision lacks clarity and logical support for the conclusion. The decision acumen demonstrated by this INITIAL RESPONSE is poor because it misinterprets the given evidence and reaches an unsupported conclusion without thoroughly evaluating other possibilities or excluding them with evidence-backed reasoning.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
