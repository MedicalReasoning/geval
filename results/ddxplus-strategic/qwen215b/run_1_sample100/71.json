Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 31\\nSex: F\\nHave you been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known heart defect?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating very irregularly or in a disorganized pattern?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America', 'options': '- Atrial fibrillation\\n- PSVT\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 31-year-old female who feels dizzy, lightheaded, and is not in the middle of any acute cardiac events, having never been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism or heart disease.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nAtrial fibrillation: Occurs with rapid, irregular heartbeat.\n\nPSVT: Paramyocardial supraventricular tachycardia.\n\nAnemia: Low red blood cells.\n\nScombroid food poisoning: Common after eating raw or undercooked seafood.\n\nAn anemia would cause fatigue, not lightheadedness, but this does not match her symptoms.\n\nHypothyroidism is not a common cause of lightheadedness.\n\nHypertension is not a cause of lightheadedness.\n\nThe most probable diagnosis is a normal clinical presentation with no other major concerns.\n\n```Normal clinical presentation```\n\nLABEL:\nAtrial fibrillation\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not demonstrate strong decision-making skills. The response begins with a misinterpretation of the information â€“ it suggests the individual feels dizzy or lightheaded, while the input explicitly states otherwise (\"Do you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded? - N\"). Furthermore, the response inaccurately highlights conditions not aligned with the provided symptoms, like hypotension and hypothyroidism, neither of which were indicated or supported by the input. \n\nThe listings of the conditions for atrial fibrillation, PSVT, anemia, and scombroid food poisoning are irrelevant to the decision-making process as the symptoms do not even exist according to the input, and there is no attempt to dissect relevant symptoms or criteria regarding these choices. The conclusion reached is \"Normal clinical presentation\" without adequately addressing the details according to the input symptoms or evidence supplied, which is not present in the input assessment. \n\nThe response concludes with a diagnosis misaligned with the label 'Atrial fibrillation,' thus illustrating a failure to address and reject negatives or elements not directly related to the specified label. This demonstrates a lack of clarity, poor judgment, and overall inadequate examination regarding the decision process.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
