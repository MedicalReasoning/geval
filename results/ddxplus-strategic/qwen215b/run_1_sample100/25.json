Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 50\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\n    - sickening\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - hypochondrium(R)\\n    - hypochondrium(L)\\n    - belly\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 9 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - upper chest\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hiatal hernia?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had stools that were black (like coal)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that get worse after eating?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N', 'options': '- GERD\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Anemia\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 50-year-old male with a burning sensation that starts in his stomach and goes up into his throat, with a bitter taste in the mouth.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making skills and does not appropriately address the given INPUT. Here are the main issues:\n\n1. **Inaccurate Representation of Evidence**: The response improperly states that the individual experiences a burning sensation starting in the stomach and moving upward, along with a bitter taste. However, the INPUT explicitly denies the presence of such symptoms (\"Do you have a burning sensation... can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth? - N\"). This misinterpretation leads to an incorrect assessment.\n\n2. **Imprecise Evaluation**: The analysis is based on incorrect evidence and doesn't correctly evaluate the symptoms presented in the INPUT. For example, the response's consideration of GERD, which was the correct option, is inaccurately justified, while Pericarditis is chosen without valid support from the evidence.\n\n3. **Failure to Distinguish Options**: The response lacks clarity in distinguishing valid options based on the evidence. It does not weigh evidence efficiently against disease characteristics, leading to an incorrect diagnosis (Pericarditis instead of GERD).\n\n4. **Lack of Logical Decision-Making**: The response fails to demonstrate logical reasoning. It erroneously supports an irrelevant option (Pericarditis) without adequately justifying its decision and does not decisively reject incorrect options based on the given symptoms.\n\nOverall, the Initial Response lacks confidence, precision, and clear justification in its decision-making process, resulting in the wrong conclusion. Thus, it does not meet the criterion for effective decision acumen.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
