Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 87\\nSex: M\\nAre you currently taking or have you recently taken anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - heavy\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - ankle(L)\\n    - thigh(L)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(R)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(L)\\n    - sole(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have heart failure?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have liver cirrhosis?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had surgery to remove lymph nodes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have swelling in one or more areas of your body?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - ankle(R)\\n    - thigh(L)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(R)\\n    - dorsal aspect of the foot(L)\\n    - sole(R)\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Localized edema\\n- Chagas\\n- Anaphylaxis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nAn 87-year-old male presenting with knee and thigh pain, which \"seems to come on suddenly.\" Pain is described as heavy, tedious, and sharp.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not display strong decision acumen. It makes imprecise conclusions and lacks clarity. Firstly, it incorrectly summarizes parts of the INPUT: the INPUT never mentions knee pain, and it lists multiple locations for pain (ankle, thigh, dorsal aspect of both feet, and sole), but does not mention knee pain specifically. Additionally, the INPUT identifies swelling in areas such as the ankle and thigh, which suggests localized edema. The INITIAL RESPONSE fails to recognize these critical details and inaccurately concludes that Chagas is the most probable diagnosis, even though the listed symptoms do not align with typical symptoms of Chagas. Furthermore, the INITIAL RESPONSE weakly dismisses localized edema and makes an unfounded claim about anaphylaxis. Thus, the decision-making in the INITIAL RESPONSE does not reflect a careful evaluation of the given evidence.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
