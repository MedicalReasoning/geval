Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates weak decision-making skills. Although it begins with an appropriate step-by-step analysis of each option, the conclusions it draws do not align with the evaluations made. The response incorrectly identifies \"Chagas\" as the most likely diagnosis without sufficient evidence to support this decision, contradicting its own analysis that ruled out Chagas due to the lack of relevant travel history. Moreover, the response repeats \"Guillain-Barré syndrome\" twice, which indicates a lack of thoroughness in review and decision-making. Consequently, the response lacks precision and clarity in distinguishing between the correct label \"Atrial fibrillation\" and other options, and fails to reject all incorrect or irrelevant options confidently. This results in a poor demonstration of decision acumen.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
