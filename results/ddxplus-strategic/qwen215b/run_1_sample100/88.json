Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 21\\nSex: M\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- PSVT\\n- Anemia\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 21-year-old male with no known heart valve issues, COPD, shortness of breath, diabetes, significant overweight, slight dizziness, and no heart attack history.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE reviews the evidence presented and evaluates the options given in the INPUT. However, the conclusions drawn appear to be inconsistent with the information provided. \n\n1. PANIC ATTACK is identified as the most likely cause, but this conclusion is illogical given the description of symptoms. The absence of recent travel or symptoms typically associated with a panic attack (e.g., chest pain, palpitations, dizziness) contradicts this diagnosis.\n\n2. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, the correct label, is dismissed without sufficient justification. Though the patient does not report palpitations or chest pain, the response fails to investigate whether the presence of otherwise limited symptoms could still align with atrial fibrillation.\n\n3. Other options analyzed, such as anemia's connection to COPD and scombroid food poisoning's irrelevance, lack reasoning aligned with the evidence provided or the patient’s symptomology.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE does not exhibit solid decision acumen. The conclusions drawn are vague, employ weak distinctions, and include a mixture of improperly dismissed or unsubstantiated options.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
