Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 27\\nSex: F\\nAre you infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\n    - sickening\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - breast(R)\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - biceps(R)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - thoracic spine\\n    - shoulder(R)\\n    - shoulder(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high cholesterol or do you take medications to treat high cholesterol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high blood pressure or do you take medications to treat high blood pressure?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a problem with poor circulation?\\n    - N\\nAre you feeling nauseous or do you feel like vomiting?\\n    - N\\nAre you a former smoker?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have close family members who had a cardiovascular disease problem before the age of 50?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- GERD\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm\\n- Chagas\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Panic attack\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 27-year-old female who is not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus and reports no pain or shortness of breath.

    "prediction": "The initial response provided in the evaluation does not exhibit strong decision acumen for several reasons:\n\n1. The response inaccurately mentions that the patient reports no pain, whereas the input specifies pain characterized as \"tedious\" and \"sickening\" in multiple locations, with an intensity of 10. This is a critical oversight indicating a lack of thorough evaluation of the information provided.\n\n2. The analysis of the conditions listed in the options is often incorrect or generic, failing to reason through why each condition may or may not apply based on the specific evidence given about the patient. For example, it mentions NSTEMI/STEMI as rare but does not consider the provided data that could suggest cardiac evaluation despite the patient's young age.\n\n3. There is a repetition of \"Myasthenia gravis: Rare in this age group,\" showing confusion and indicating a lack of precise decision-making.\n\n4. Throughout the evaluation, the initial response frequently claims conditions as rare in the age group without connecting how the symptoms present align or do not align with those conditions, illustrating a failure to prioritize and interpret relevant symptomatology.\n\n5. The conclusion, \"Sarcoidosis,\" is made without adequate justification or alignment with the input, and it is neither discussed nor evaluated critically in the context of the patient's symptoms to support such a diagnosis.\n\nOverall, the initial response lacks preciseness, inaccurately represents the input data, and fails to adequately dismiss incorrect options or substantiate the decision made. Therefore, it is rated as lacking in decision acumen.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
