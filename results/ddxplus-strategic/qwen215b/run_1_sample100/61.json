Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 35\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - side of the neck(R)\\n    - palace\\n    - pharynx\\n    - trachea\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diabetes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high blood pressure or do you take medications to treat high blood pressure?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed that the tone of your voice has become deeper, softer or hoarse?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Epiglottitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Larygospasm\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Unstable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 35-year-old female with throat pain (knife-like, sharp), pain localized to the tonsils, difficulty breathing, and no shortness of breath.

The symptoms described in the INPUT—such as throat pain and absence of shortness of breath or cardiovascular issues—do not support a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. The response fails to engage in a thorough evaluation and incorrectly dismisses other possibilities without clear reasoning. It inaccurately dismisses the option \"Acute laryngitis,\" despite the presence of throat pain. The reasoning lacks depth and fails to decisively identify the correct choice given the symptoms, which is \"Epiglottitis.\"\n\nBased on the given criterion, the initial response lacks precise decision-making, fails to reject incorrect options appropriately, and does not align its conclusions with the provided INPUT.\n\nPREDICTION:```No```"
