Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 17\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - breast(L)\\n    - epigastric\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pericarditis\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- PSVT\\n- GERD\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Panic attack\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 17-year-old female with a pain characterized as a knife stroke in the breast (L side) with a sharpness, rated 4 out of 10 on a scale from 0 to 10. The pain does not radiate, is not precise, and does not appear suddenly. She feels no shortness of breath, is not experiencing palpitations, has not traveled recently, and the pain is not worse when lying down. The pain is alleviated when sitting up.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- Pericarditis: Uncommon in this age and gender, and the symptoms don't match.\n\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax: Occurs in the chest, not the breast.\n\n- Pulmonary embolism: Can cause shortness of breath and chest pain.\n\n- PSVT: Not common in this age.\n\n- GERD: Possible but not a sharp, localized pain.\n\n- Atrial fibrillation: Causes palpitations but not shortness of breath.\n\n- Myocarditis: Typically causes symptoms like fever and chest pain.\n\n- Panic attack: Fit with the sudden onset and sharp pain.\n\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome: Can cause sharp pain but not in the breast.\n\n- Boerhaave: Rare but not sharp pain.\n\n- Scombroid food poisoning: Not sharp and not in the breast.\n\n- Acute dystonic reactions: Not sharp.\n\n- Myasthenia gravis: Can cause pain but not in the breast.\n\n- Anemia: Not sharp.\n\n- Sarcoidosis: Not sharp.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is Panic attack.\n\n```Panic attack```\n\nLABEL:\nPericarditis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE attempts to evaluate the input evidence against the given options to arrive at a decision for the diagnosis. However, there are inaccuracies and logical missteps:\n\n1. **Incorrect Summary of Evidence**: The initial response incorrectly states that the pain does not radiate and is alleviated by sitting up. According to the INPUT, the pain does radiate to the posterior chest wall, and there's no information on it being alleviated by sitting up.\n\n2. **Decision Acumen**:\n   - The response fails to accurately incorporate critical input information, such as pain radiation to the posterior chest wall, into its analysis.\n   - The response rejects conditions like \"Spontaneous pneumothorax\" without strong justification as it mentions chest versus breast pain, ignoring the radiation aspect which could be commonly associated with pneumothorax.\n   - It lacks precise reasoning for ruling out \"Pericarditis,\" which is the correct label. Pericarditis can indeed occur in young females and may present as sharp, pleuritic chest pain that radiates.\n   \n3. **Inaccurate Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion of a \"Panic attack\" does not align coherently with the presented symptoms, especially given the presence of radiating sharp pain and the absence of respiratory or heart-related symptoms typical for panic attacks.\n\nOverall, the response does not clearly demonstrate thorough evaluation or precise decision-making aligned with the evidence from the INPUT.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
