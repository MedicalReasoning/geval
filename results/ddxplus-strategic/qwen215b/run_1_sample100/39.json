Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 24\\nSex: F\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Larygospasm'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 24-year-old female with no history of asthma or bronchodilator use.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE does not accurately demonstrate strong decision acumen based on the provided input. The breakdown of information regarding the patient's lack of history that could lead to laryngospasm is correct. However, the analysis fails in two critical areas:\n\n1. The response states, \"Larygospasm: Usually seen in smoking patients,\" which is not entirely accurate. Laryngospasm can occur in various conditions, including those completely unrelated to smoking. However, it does note this could be seen in smoking patients, which may imply some causality without completely dismissing it.\n\n2. The conclusion drawn is \"The most probable diagnosis is Oropharyngeal (Laryngopharyngeal) dysphagia,\" which is not supported by the given evidence. None of the input information suggests symptoms that align with dysphagia, such as difficulty swallowing, and no evidence links dysphagia with the stated LABEL of \"Larygospasm.\"\n\nThus, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and does not decisively address whether \"Larygospasm\" is an appropriate answer nor does it justify rejecting this hard negative as would be necessary for sound decision-making.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
