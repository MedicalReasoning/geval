Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 64\\nSex: F\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nHave you had one or several flare ups of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the past year?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux?\\n    - N\\nDo you work in agriculture?\\n    - N\\nDo you work in the mining sector?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- PSVT\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 64-year-old female with shortness of breath, chronic cough, no color or增多的脓痰，未诊断过GERD，未从事过农业或矿业工作，最近没有出过境，没有出现喘鸣声。她的症状与急性COPD（慢性阻塞性肺病）有关。\n\n```Acute COPD exacerbation / infection```\n\nLABEL:\nAcute COPD exacerbation / infection\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE fails to demonstrate strong decision-making skills based on the available INPUT. Despite correctly stating that the 64-year-old female does not have shortness of breath, COPD, or other symptoms and conditions typically associated with acute COPD exacerbation or infection, it still concludes with \"Acute COPD exacerbation / infection\" without justification. The response does not provide a logical explanation for this conclusion and fails to decisively reject this option based on the evidence provided. Moreover, it mentions symptoms like \"shortness of breath\" and \"chronic cough\" that contradict the evidence (both marked as 'N'). Therefore, it lacks clarity and exhibits poor decision acumen.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
