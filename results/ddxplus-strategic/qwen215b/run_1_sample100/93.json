Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 2\\nSex: M\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - pharynx\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 4 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a wheezing sound when you exhale?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation\\n- Influenza\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Allergic sinusitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- URTI\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Croup\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT\\n- SLE\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 2-year-old male with a burning pain on the side of the chest.

    "prediction": "The INPUT provides a case of a 2-year-old male experiencing a burning, non-radiating pain on the side of the chest. The options provided for possible diagnoses include several conditions, and the INITIAL RESPONSE evaluates each option. The INITIAL RESPONSE rules out many of them based on typical presentations and compatibility with the evidence given (e.g., considering the age of the patient and symptom match or mismatch).\n\nHowever, despite the evaluation, the INITIAL RESPONSE concludes with \"Viral pharyngitis\" as the most likely diagnosis. On the other hand, the case label suggests \"Bronchitis\" as the correct response. \n\nThe INITIAL RESPONSE dismisses \"Bronchitis\" by stating it is more likely associated with cough, yet bronchitis could also present in children without cough as an initial symptom. The fact that \"Bronchitis\" was dismissed without strong evidence specific to the input is a potential lack in decision-making acumen, as the decision should be firmly grounded in the evidence presented.\n\nMoreover, while the reasoning is thorough in considering and eliminating options, it fails to convincingly explain why \"Bronchitis,\" the actual label, should be ruled out, thus leading to the incorrect final conclusion. Consequently, the decision-making is not wholly aligned with the evidence, indicating less precision in distinguishing between valid and invalid options based on the given input.\n\nPREDICTION: ```PREDICTION```No```"
