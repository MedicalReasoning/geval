    "model_input": "[Task Description]\nYou will be given INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE.\nYou task is to evaluate INITIAL RESPONSE based on the criterion.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 51\\nSex: M\\nDo you have an active cancer?\\n    - N\\nHave you been coughing up blood?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - a knife stroke\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - side of the chest(R)\\n    - side of the chest(L)\\n    - scapula(R)\\n    - scapula(L)\\n    - posterior chest wall(R)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?\\n    - N\\nHave you been unable to move or get up for more than 3 consecutive days within the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have swelling in one or more areas of your body?\\n    - N\\nWhere is the swelling located?\\n    - posterior aspect of the ankle(L)\\n    - calf(L)\\nHave you had surgery within the last month?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - North America\\nDo you have pain that is increased when you breathe in deeply?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Pulmonary neoplasm\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Panic attack\\n- Spontaneous pneumothorax\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Boerhaave\\n- Ebola\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Guillain-Barré syndrome\\n- Atrial fibrillation\\n- GERD\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anemia\\n- Sarcoidosis\\n- PSVT'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 51-year-old male without any signs of active cancer, coughing up blood, and pain in the right lower chest.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE falls short of demonstrating effective decision acumen. \n\n- The response starts with an overview of the patient's condition but repeats some information inaccurately, e.g., \"pain in the right lower chest\" rather than summarizing all specified areas.\n- It incorrectly combines individual symptom locations into one generalized location when the input indicates multiple specific pain locations.\n- The response does not provide a strong link or deliberation as to why Myocarditis is the most certain diagnosis, failing to clarify connections between specific symptoms and the conclusion.\n- It incorrectly claims \"Myocarditis is not typical for this age\" when more evidence is needed to support the typicality of this condition given the patient's symptom presentation.\n- Instead of eliminating options primarily based on the given data, many choices are dismissed improperly by solely stating \"Not typical for this age.\"\n- There is no consideration for specific symptoms or conditions more attributable to Myocarditis, such as the intensity and location of pain, completely overlooked.\n\nThus, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity in distinguishing correct options from incorrect ones or irrelevant pieces, not fully supporting its conclusion. The evaluation does not provide a solid justification, rejecting negatives decisively and correctly based on evidence from INPUT.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
