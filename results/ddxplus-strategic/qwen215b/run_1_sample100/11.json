Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 28\\nSex: F\\nDo you live with 4 or more people?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nHave you had significantly increased sweating?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - tedious\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - forehead\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 7 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 0 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a cough that produces colored or more abundant sputum than usual?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a sore throat?\\n    - N\\nDo you have diffuse (widespread) muscle pain?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- URTI\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Influenza\\n- Cluster headache\\n- Bronchiectasis\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Chagas\\n- Anemia'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 28-year-old female with a sore throat, diffuse muscle pain, nasal congestion, and a cough without cough producing colored or more abundant sputum. \n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- URTI: Commonly presents with fever and cold symptoms.\n\n- Bronchitis: Common in smokers and has symptoms of cough and sore throat.\n\n- Pneumonia: Presents with fever, cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath.\n\n- Influenza: Viral infection, typically presenting with fever and body aches.\n\n- Cluster headache: Sharp, severe, and frequent pain.\n\n- Bronchiectasis: Chronic cough and prolonged effort produces sputum.\n\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis: Chronic inflamed sinusitis.\n\n- Acute rhinosinusitis: Inflammation of the nasal passages.\n\n- Chagas: Anemia and heart failure.\n\n- Anemia: Red blood cell count below normal.\n\nNotably, the symptoms suggest a viral infection, which fits best with URTI.\n\n```URTI```\n\nLABEL:\nURTI\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE's decision-making process is flawed due to several key reasons:\n\n1. **Inaccurate Symptom Representation**: The Initial Response states that the patient is experiencing a sore throat, diffuse muscle pain, nasal congestion, and a cough. However, the patient's symptom profile from the INPUT indicates \"N\" (No) for sore throat, muscle pain, nasal congestion, and cough. This discrepancy shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the provided patient information.\n\n2. **Lack of Evidence-Based Analysis**: The response does not address specific symptoms accurately and requires cross-referencing with the evidence. As a result, the step-by-step deliberation is based on incorrect or imagined symptoms rather than those explicitly stated in the INPUT.\n\n3. **Ineffective Option Evaluation**: Incorrect symptoms leading to incorrect evaluations are reflected in choosing URTI. The choice of URTI is not founded on any relevant or supportive evidence from the INPUT and stands unwarranted compared to objective hard negatives, like a headache, which genuinely reflect the patient's stated symptoms.\n\n4. **Failure to Eliminate Irrelevant Options**: The Initial Response fails to robustly justify rejecting options like Cluster headache, which directly aligns with the symptom of severe forehead pain and intensity level provided, showcasing weak decision-making skills. \n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and accuracy in both evaluating the evidence and making informed conclusions, grounded on the INPUT data.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
