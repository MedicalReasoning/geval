Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 70\\nSex: M\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(R)\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - pharynx\\n    - under the jaw\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 5 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 70-year-old male without a fever, cough, travel history, or symptoms of other known conditions (bronchitis, laryngitis, pneumonia, or chest pain). He has no tonsillar symptoms, pharyngeal pain, jaw pain, or a region of pain sensitive to touch. The pain is described as \"sensitive to touch,\" not \"burning.\" The pain is not localized to any specific part of the throat or jaw (no right or left tonsillar region), it appears quickly (not \"worsening over time\"), and intensity is not specified. Pain is not felt (no \"no fever\" or \"no cough\"). The patient does not have a travel history.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n- Bronchitis: Not mentioned.\n- Acute laryngitis: Not related to sensitivity or sensitivity to touch.\n- Tuberculosis: Not mentioned.\n- Viral pharyngitis: Not mentioned.\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI: Not mentioned.\n- Unstable angina: Not mentioned.\n\nThe patient's symptoms suggest possible acute laryngitis, not likely to be bronchitis or laryngitis, and ruled out for acute laryngitis (not sensitive, not burning, not localized to throat, not identified tonsillar or pharyngeal involvement). The patient does not have a travel history and is not feverish. No cough. Acute laryngitis is a less likely diagnosis compared to other options. The patient's history fits more closely with a viral pharyngitis, which is less likely to be caused by an infection.\n\n```Viral pharyngitis```\n\nLABEL:\nViral pharyngitis\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:",

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE fails to clearly support its decision-making process. It inaccurately states that the patient doesn't have tonsillar or pharyngeal pain despite the evidence indicating pain at multiple specific locations (tonsils R&L, pharynx, under the jaw) with an intensity level of 5. It mentions that the pain is not burning, but according to the INPUT, the pain is indeed described as burning. The response misinterprets the evidence by stating that the pain is not localized and is unrelated to fever and cough, which are expected in bronchitis or laryngitis, and it provides a faulty analysis inconsistent with the provided symptoms. The leap to a conclusion, \"Viral pharyngitis,\" mentions it isn't a result of infection while it clearly is an infectious process, is not founded on a thorough and precise evaluation. Subsequently, decision acumen is poor due to an evident lack of clarity, careful consideration, and understanding of the provided symptoms and their application to potential options.\n\nPREDICTION: ```No```"
