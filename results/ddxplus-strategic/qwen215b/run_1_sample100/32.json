Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 51\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - sensitive\\n    - a knife stroke\\n    - tugging\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\n    - belly\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you think you are pregnant or are you currently pregnant?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that get worse after eating?\\n    - N', 'options': '- GERD\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Spontaneous rib fracture\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Tuberculosis\\n- Stable angina\\n- Pancreatic neoplasm'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nPatient is 51 years old with a burning sensation associated with a bitter taste in the mouth, no cough, no traveling in the last 4 weeks.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE missed several key elements from the INPUT that negatively impacted its decision-making acumen:\n\n1. The response inaccurately described the patient's symptoms, indicating a burning sensation with a bitter taste, which contradicts the INPUT stating no such sensation exists. This misinterpretation leads to incorrect reasoning in decision-making.\n2. The decision-making process should focus on pain characteristics and locationâ€”from the INPUT, the patient's pain is not guttural, specifically targeting areas like lower and upper chest, and the belly with intensity rated at 6. There's no rationale given for the decision of a spontaneous rib fracture, nor does it appropriately consider GERD.\n3. The response does not distinguish between the relevance of different symptoms effectively, making premature conclusions that don't align with the evidence provided in the INPUT.\n4. There is no explanation justifying why GERD, the labeled condition, is not the conclusion while spontaneous rib fracture is explicitly decided as the diagnosis. No evidence from the INPUT supports such a diagnosis.\n\nOverall, the INITIAL RESPONSE shows weak decision-making skills, lacks consideration for all available evidence, and leads to an incorrect conclusion. Therefore, it doesn't meet the criterion for exceptional decision acumen.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
