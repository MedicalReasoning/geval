Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nDecision Acumen (Yes / No): How effectively does the INITIAL RESPONSE make concise and precise decisions through careful deliberation, clearly distinguishing between positive and negative answers, and appropriately rejecting hard negatives when necessary?\nThe initial response should demonstrate strong decision-making skills by evaluating the available information thoroughly, weighing evidence, and arriving at a precise conclusion. It should confidently reject incorrect or irrelevant options while clearly supporting its decisions with reasoning grounded in the INPUT.\n\nFor your information:\nNo indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making, with imprecise conclusions, weak distinctions between valid and invalid options, or a failure to reject incorrect or irrelevant information. Such a response lacks clarity and fails to exhibit thoughtful deliberation.\nYes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE exhibits exceptional decision acumen, making concise and precise distinctions based on thorough evaluation. The response decisively identifies the correct conclusions, explicitly rejects hard negatives with clear justification, and maintains a logical and deliberate approach. It demonstrates a high level of confidence and precision in its decision-making process, well-aligned with the INPUT.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.\n2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Decision Acumen decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 49\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - haunting\\n    - sensitive\\n    - tugging\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\n    - hypochondrium(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - lower chest\\n    - upper chest\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 3 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 2 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nAre you significantly overweight compared to people of the same height as you?\\n    - N\\nDo you drink alcohol excessively or do you have an addiction to alcohol?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hiatal hernia?\\n    - N\\nHave you recently had stools that were black (like coal)?\\n    - N\\nDo you think you are pregnant or are you currently pregnant?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a burning sensation that starts in your stomach then goes up into your throat, and can be associated with a bitter taste in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your symptoms worse when lying down and alleviated while sitting up?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Bronchitis\\n- GERD\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Pericarditis\\n- Anemia\\n- Stable angina\\n- Boerhaave'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step.\n\nA 49-year-old female with chest pain that starts in her stomach and makes it feel like coal.

    "prediction": "The INITIAL RESPONSE demonstrates poor decision-making skills according to the given criteria. The reasoning and conclusions are not precise and fail to align with the INPUT. The responder neglected to acknowledge several relevant evidence points, such as the absence of a burning sensation that starts in the stomach and moves upwards, which is a significant symptom of GERD. Additionally, the Initial Response misrepresents the evidence by detailing symptoms like \"chest pain that starts in her stomach and makes it feel like coal,\" which was not mentioned in the INPUT. The final diagnosis of 'Pericarditis' lacks appropriate justification. It fails to decisively reject GERD as the correct answer and does not show thorough evaluation consistent with the given evidence. The response lacks clarity and doesn't exhibit thoughtful deliberation required to arrive at a precise conclusion.\n\n```PREDICTION```No```"
