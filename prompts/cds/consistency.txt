[Task Description]
You will be given INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE.
You task is to evaluate INITIAL RESPONSE based on the criterion.
Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


[Criterion]
Consistency (Yes / No): How coherent and logically consistent is the INITIAL RESPONSE in its reasoning, without gaps in logic or reliance on reasoning shortcuts?
The initial response should maintain a clear and coherent flow of thought, avoiding contradictions or leaps in logic. It should address all relevant aspects of the INPUT thoroughly, ensuring the reasoning is complete, well-structured, and methodical.

For your information:
No indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks coherence and contains significant gaps in reasoning. Such a response might skip important logical steps, rely on unsupported assumptions, or exhibit contradictions that undermine its overall validity.
Yes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly consistent and well-reasoned, with a seamless and logical progression of thought. Every aspect of the INPUT is addressed in a systematic and thorough manner, with no significant gaps, contradictions, or oversimplifications in the reasoning. The response demonstrates a deep and methodical approach to analyzing the problem.

[Evaluation Steps]
1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.
2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion above.
3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.
4. ALWAYS provide the Consistency decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.
