[Task Description]
You will be given INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE.
You task is to evaluate INITIAL RESPONSE based on the criterion.
Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


[Criterion]
Explainability (Yes / No): How clear, informative, and persuasive is the INITIAL RESPONSE to medical experts receiving it?
The initial response should communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily understandable, well-structured, and compelling for its intended audience. It should present reasoning and conclusions transparently, providing sufficient context and justification for each claim or step in the reasoning process.

For your information:
No indicates that the INITIAL RESPONSE lacks clarity and fails to provide adequate explanations for its claims or reasoning. Such a response may be vague, overly simplistic, or confusing, making it difficult for medical experts to follow or trust the information presented.
Yes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is highly explainable, delivering medical information and reasoning with exceptional clarity and precision. The response thoroughly justifies its conclusions, providing well-articulated explanations that are persuasive, logically sound, and directly relevant to the INPUT. It ensures that even complex concepts are conveyed in an accessible and professional manner suitable for a medical expert audience.

[Evaluation Steps]
1. Read INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE carefully.
2. Output INITIAL RESPONSE as either Yes or No according to the criterion and given label above.
3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.
4. ALWAYS provide the Explainability decision as either ```Yes``` or ```No``` after the word PREDICTION, wrapped in triple backticks, like this: ```PREDICTION```Yes``` or ```PREDICTION```No```.
