[Task Description]
You will be given INPUT and INITIAL RESPONSE.
You task is to evaluate INITIAL RESPONSE based on the criterion.
Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


[Criterion]
Knowledge Correctness (Yes / No): How accurate and reliable is the INITIAL RESPONSE in terms of the factual information it provides?
The initial response should demonstrate a high level of medical knowledge, free from significant inaccuracies, and align with established medical guidelines or evidence-based practices. The response should also use correct terminology and avoid misleading or unsupported claims based on the INPUT.

For your information:
No indicates that the majority of the content in the INITIAL RESPONSE contains significant factual inaccuracies or unsupported claims, failing to provide reliable medical knowledge. Such a response may include incorrect terminology, misinterpret established medical guidelines, or present information that is misleading or irrelevant to the INPUT.
Yes signifies that the INITIAL RESPONSE is exceptionally accurate and reliable, demonstrating a deep understanding of medical knowledge. The response is free from factual errors, uses correct terminology, and adheres to evidence-based medical practices. All claims are well-supported and relevant to the INPUT, ensuring trustworthiness and precision in the conveyed information.
